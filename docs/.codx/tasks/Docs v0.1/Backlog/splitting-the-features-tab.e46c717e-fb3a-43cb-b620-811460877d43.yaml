- content: "Certainly! Splitting the `features.md` file into individual files for\
    \ each feature will make the documentation more organized and easier to manage.\
    \ Here\u2019s how we can do it:\n\n1. **Create a new directory** for the features\
    \ if it doesn't already exist.\n2. **Split the content** of `features.md` into\
    \ individual files, one for each feature.\n3. **Update the main `features.md`\
    \ file** to include links to the new feature files.\n\n### Step 1: Create a New\
    \ Directory\nFirst, create a directory named `features` in the `docs` folder if\
    \ it doesn't already exist.\n\n```sh\nmkdir -p /home/codx-junior/codx-junior/docs/features\n\
    ```\n\n### Step 2: Split the Content\nNow, let's split the content of `features.md`\
    \ into individual files.\n\n#### `collaboration.md`\n```markdown\n## Collaboration\n\
    \nCollaborate with team members through mentions. **Benefit**: Encourages effective\
    \ communication and collaboration among distributed teams.\n\nManage user profiles\
    \ for better collaboration. **Benefit**: Personalizes the contributor experience,\
    \ fostering a sense of community.\n```\n\n#### `knowledge-sharing.md`\n```markdown\n\
    ## Knowledge Sharing\n\n`codx-junior` leverages advanced RAG indexing for improved\
    \ AI responses and knowledge dissemination.\n\nAccess and contribute to shared\
    \ knowledge bases. **Benefit**: Centralizes documentation and knowledge, making\
    \ it easier for contributors to find and share information.\n```\n\n#### `development-tools.md`\n\
    ```markdown\n## Development Tools\n\nWhile `codx-junior` defaults to code-server,\
    \ feel free to use your favorite IDE or tools.\n\nManage global configurations\
    \ and data models. **Benefit**: Ensures consistency across different development\
    \ environments.\nIntegrate custom tools to enhance development. **Benefit**: Allows\
    \ contributors to use tools they are comfortable with, increasing productivity.\n\
    ```\n\n#### `settings.md`\n```markdown\n## Settings\n\nCustomize settings to tailor\
    \ your project needs. **Benefit**: Offers flexibility in configuration, accommodating\
    \ different project requirements.\n```\n\n#### `project-dashboard.md`\n```markdown\n\
    ## Project's Dashboard\n\nFind all projects easily on the project's dashboard.\n\
    ```\n\n#### `project-management.md`\n```markdown\n## Project Management\n\nLet\
    \ `codx-junior` lend a hand with project management. It keeps tasks synced with\
    \ your codebase, ensuring consistency and organization throughout your project.\n\
    \n> \U0001F4A1 Use the profiles to fine tune how you like the tasks to be structure\n\
    \nDefine and organize your project structure. **Benefit**: Offers a clear overview,\
    \ making it easier for contributors to understand and contribute effectively.\n\
    ```\n\n#### `tasks.md`\n```markdown\n## Tasks\n\n`codx-junior` is agile by nature\
    \ but can adapt to any strategy you prefer. Just let us know your methodology\
    \ of choice, and watch `codx-junior` adjust.\n\nVisualize and manage tasks with\
    \ an integrated Kanban board. **Benefit**: Enhances transparency and task tracking\
    \ for contributors.\nBreak down tasks into manageable subtasks. **Benefit**: Boosts\
    \ task delegation and workload management in open-source projects.\n```\n\n####\
    \ `code-generation-and-review.md`\n```markdown\n## Code Generation and Review\n\
    \nMove seamlessly from analysis to development, straight from tasks, to amp up\
    \ your development efficiency.\n\nAutomate code generation for repetitive tasks.\
    \ **Benefit**: Streamlines development, letting contributors focus on impactful\
    \ coding.\nReview code changes efficiently. **Benefit**: Promotes a structured\
    \ and consistent code review process, crucial for maintaining code quality in\
    \ open-source projects.\n```\n\n#### `deployment-and-operations.md`\n```markdown\n\
    ## Deployment and Operations\n\nDocker ready, `codx-junior` simplifies your deployment\
    \ processes.\n\nSimplify containerization with Docker support. **Benefit**: Provides\
    \ a consistent testing and deployment environment, reducing configuration discrepancies.\n\
    Generate code specific to Docker tasks. **Benefit**: Automates deployment tasks,\
    \ making it easier for contributors to deploy and test changes.\n```\n\n#### `collaboration-and-communication.md`\n\
    ```markdown\n## Collaboration and Communication\n\nJust mention codx on any file\
    \ to get its help immediately!\n```\n\n### Step 3: Update the Main `features.md`\
    \ File\nFinally, update the main `features.md` file to include links to the new\
    \ feature files.\n\n```markdown\n# Features\n\n- [Collaboration](features/collaboration.md)\n\
    - [Knowledge Sharing](features/knowledge-sharing.md)\n- [Development Tools](features/development-tools.md)\n\
    - [Settings](features/settings.md)\n- [Project's Dashboard](features/project-dashboard.md)\n\
    - [Project Management](features/project-management.md)\n- [Tasks](features/tasks.md)\n\
    - [Code Generation and Review](features/code-generation-and-review.md)\n- [Deployment\
    \ and Operations](features/deployment-and-operations.md)\n- [Collaboration and\
    \ Communication](features/collaboration-and-communication.md)\n```\n\n### Step\
    \ 4: Commit and Push Changes\nAfter splitting the content and updating the main\
    \ `features.md` file, commit the changes to Git and push them to the remote repository.\n\
    \n```sh\ngit add /home/codx-junior/codx-junior/docs/features/\ngit add /home/codx-junior/codx-junior/docs/features.md\n\
    git commit -m \"Split features.md into individual feature files\"\ngit push\n\
    ```\n\nThis approach ensures that the documentation is well-organized and easy\
    \ to navigate, following best practices for software development and version control."
