Certainly! Splitting the `features.md` file into individual files for each feature will make the documentation more organized and easier to manage. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. **Create a new directory** for the features if it doesn't already exist.
2. **Split the content** of `features.md` into individual files, one for each feature.
3. **Update the main `features.md` file** to include links to the new feature files.

### Step 1: Create a New Directory
First, create a directory named `features` in the `docs` folder if it doesn't already exist.

```sh
mkdir -p /home/codx-junior/codx-junior/docs/features
```

### Step 2: Split the Content
Now, let's split the content of `features.md` into individual files.

#### `collaboration.md`
```markdown

Just mention codx on any file to get its help immediately!
```

### Step 3: Update the Main `features.md` File
Finally, update the main `features.md` file to include links to the new feature files.

```markdown
# Features

- [Collaboration](features/collaboration.md)
- [Knowledge Sharing](features/knowledge-sharing.md)
- [Development Tools](features/development-tools.md)
- [Settings](features/settings.md)
- [Project's Dashboard](features/project-dashboard.md)
- [Project Management](features/project-management.md)
- [Tasks](features/tasks.md)
- [Code Generation and Review](features/code-generation-and-review.md)
- [Deployment and Operations](features/deployment-and-operations.md)
- [Collaboration and Communication](features/collaboration-and-communication.md)
```

### Step 4: Commit and Push Changes
After splitting the content and updating the main `features.md` file, commit the changes to Git and push them to the remote repository.

```sh
git add /home/codx-junior/codx-junior/docs/features/
git add /home/codx-junior/codx-junior/docs/features.md
git commit -m "Split features.md into individual feature files"
git push
```

This approach ensures that the documentation is well-organized and easy to navigate, following best practices for software development and version control.
