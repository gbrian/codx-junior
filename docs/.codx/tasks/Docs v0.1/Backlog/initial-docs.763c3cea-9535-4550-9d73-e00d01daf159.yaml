- content: "# What is codx-junior?\n\ncodx-junior is a powerful tool designed to assist\
    \ with project management, code generation, and collaboration. It provides a comprehensive\
    \ suite of features to help you manage your projects more efficiently and effectively.\n\
    \n# Installation\n\nTo install codx-junior, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clone\
    \ the Repository**:\n   ```sh\n   git clone https://github.com/codx-junior/codx-junior.git\n\
    \   cd codx-junior\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**:\n   ```sh\n   npm install\n\
    \   ```\n\n3. **Start the Application**:\n   ```sh\n   npm start\n   ```\n\nAfter\
    \ installing and running codx-junior, navigate to `http://localhost:19981` or\
    \ any other port you set in the environment settings.\n\n# Basic Setup\n\n## First\
    \ Login\n\nLogin with the \"admin\" user for the first time using your chosen\
    \ password. This password will be set as the admin password. You can change it\
    \ later from the \"Account settings\".\n\n# Load a Project\n\n## Adding a Project\n\
    \nAfter logging in, you'll be presented with the project's dashboard where you'll\
    \ see all projects that codx-junior is managing. Click on a project to work on\
    \ it or add a new project.\n\n### Adding a New Project\n\nYou can add a new project\
    \ by cloning from a Git repository or by providing a full path to its folder.\
    \ Paste the URL or path into the input control and press the \"+\" button to start.\n\
    \nThe new project will become the active project, and you can start working on\
    \ it.\n\n# Knowledge Settings\n\nTo help codx-junior have a better understanding\
    \ and produce better results, it's important to set up the knowledge settings.\
    \ Knowledge allows codx-junior and any user to have a better understanding of\
    \ the project.\n\n# Project Settings\n\nWe recommend checking the project settings\
    \ and adapting them to your needs. By default, all new projects will use the models\
    \ defined in the global settings.\n\n# Global Settings\n\nGlobal settings are\
    \ used to configure the overall behavior of codx-junior. These settings apply\
    \ to all projects managed by codx-junior.\n\n# Profiles\n\nProfiles are the best\
    \ way to define how you like your project to be maintained. You can create as\
    \ many profiles as needed to ensure that your project is maintained according\
    \ to your preferences.\n\nProfiles can be used in conversations, tasks, file changes,\
    \ improve new content generation, keep code quality, and more.\n\n# Tasks / Kanban\n\
    \nThe Kanban board is a powerful project management section where codx-junior\
    \ keeps tasks in order. You and your team can start working on tasks here.\n\n\
    > It's possible to create new functionalities without having to write a single\
    \ line once you manage the Kanban!\n\nFor better results, we recommend stopping\
    \ by the Profiles section and meeting codx-junior assistants.\n\n# Coder\n\nThe\
    \ Coder feature helps with code generation and review. You can automate code generation\
    \ for repetitive tasks and review code changes efficiently.\n\n# Preview\n\nThe\
    \ Preview feature allows you to see a preview of your changes before committing\
    \ them to the project.\n\n# Wiki\n\nThe Wiki is a place where you can document\
    \ your project and share knowledge with your team. It's a valuable resource for\
    \ maintaining a clear and organized project structure."
