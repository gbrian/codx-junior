# codx-junior
Your junior assistant for Full Stack Developers... without too much time to lose ;)

## Motivation

As a Full Stack Developer working for different customers, I'm supposed to be able to deal with everything, know everything, and fix everything... ASAP!
> From front, to back, to database, cloud, DevOps...

and don't get me wrong, I love it! but it's a titan task, don't you? 

So I started developing codx-junior to have an AI that can manage all tedious and repetitive tasks in software development and IT. 

I want codx-junior to help me deal with projects I don't know and situations where `"the last developer left yesterday and there's no doc."` 

I want codx-junior to write better `code` than me, better `tests` than me, and, of course, keep `documentation` updated.
