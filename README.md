Your "junior" assistant for Full Stack Developers

## Motivation
So, picture this: you're a full stack developer, constantly juggling a zillion different technologies and trying to make sense of all the undocumented code out there.

Over time, I've crafted my own tricks to decode and fix these wild codebases, but let's be real, it gets pretty tedious. Enter the era of large language models (LLMs) â€“ our new coding sidekicks! They inspired me to whip up codx-junior, a nifty tool that's got your back no matter what tech stack you're dealing with or how sparse the documentation is.
