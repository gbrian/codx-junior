# codx-junior
Your junior assistant for Full Stack Developers

## Motivation
Hi, as a Full Stack Developer there's plenty of things that are repetitive, can be automated or just I don't know!

So I started adapting gpt-engineer to help me coding, speeding developments, improving tests, and teaching me when dealing with techs that I'm rusty.

## Features

### Tasks

### Mentions

Mentions allow you to reference specific parts of your project or codebase for easier management and collaboration. Below is a demonstration video on how to use mentions effectively:

[![codx-junior Mentions Demo](assets/codx_mentions_demo.webm)](assets/codx_mentions_demo.webm)

To use mentions, simply include the `@codx-processing` tag followed by the specific instruction or note you want to add. For example:
```markdown
@codx-processing: --knowledge @codx-junior-api Add a link to webm video from "assets/codx_mentions_demo.webm". And explain about mentions and how to use it
```
This will notify the system to process the mention and make the necessary changes or additions.

This project started by adding new features to https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer ...but was never merged.
Nowadays codx branch has nothing in common with gpt-enginner master so it's time to create a new project for it.
