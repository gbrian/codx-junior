# codx-junior
Your junior assistant for Full Stack Developers

## Motivation
Hi, as a Full Stack Developer there's plenty of things that are repetitive, can be automated or just I don't know!

So I started adapting gpt-engineer to help me coding, speeding developments, improving tests, and teaching me when dealing with techs that I'm rusty.

This project started by adding new features to https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer ...but was never merged.
Nowadays codx branch has nothing in common with gpt-enginner master so it's time to create a new project for it.
