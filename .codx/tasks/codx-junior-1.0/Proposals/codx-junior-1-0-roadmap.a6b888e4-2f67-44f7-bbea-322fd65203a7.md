codx-junior 1.0 roadmap document
codx-junior is a modern AI platform created to fill the gap between Project Management and Development.
At codx-junior each project becomes its own AI that can assist members.
At codx-junior, BU (Business Users), PM (Project Managers) and FSD (Full Stack Developers) team up with the AI projects to work together seamlessly over the same tasks.
  
How it works:
Connect your projects using git repositories to codx-junior in the Projects section.
This project will become your first AI that you can finetune using the Profiles and Knowledge Section.
codx-junior will start building the realtime "Wiki" and "Knowledge" to assist during your work.
Go to Kanban and start creating tasks with the project, and other team members.
You decide how deep or detailed you want the task before jumping into the "coder" to implement it
When you are done, review your changes and push them to the main repository!


Functionalities:
 * Project Manager
 * Kanban

# Codx-Junior 1.0 Roadmap Document

## Introduction

**Codx-Junior** is a cutting-edge AI platform designed to bridge the gap between Project Management and Development. It allows each project to transform into its own AI entity, assisting team members throughout the project's lifecycle. By integrating Business Users (BU), Project Managers (PM), and Full Stack Developers (FSD) with project-specific AIs, teams can achieve seamless collaboration on shared tasks.

## How Codx-Junior Works

1. **Connecting Projects:**
   - Link your projects using Git repositories in the Projects section of Codx-Junior.
   - This connection transforms your project into an AI that can be further customized.

   **Example:**

   ```plaintext
   1. Navigate to the Projects section on Codx-Junior.
   2. Click on "Connect Project."
   3. Enter the URL of your Git repository.
   4. Confirm to establish the link.
   ```

2. **Fine-Tuning Your AI:**
   - Utilize the Profiles and Knowledge Section to fine-tune your project AI.
   - Develop a "Wiki" and "Knowledge" base in real-time to assist your work processes.

3. **Creating and Managing Tasks:**
   - Access the Kanban board to create and manage tasks alongside your AI and team members.
   - Determine the level of detail for tasks before using the "Coder" feature to implement solutions.

   **Example:**

   ```plaintext
   1. Go to the Kanban board.
   2. Click on "Create New Task."
   3. Assign a title and description.
   4. Set priority and assignee from your team.
   5. Save to add the task to your board.
   ```

4. **Reviewing and Pushing Changes:**
   - After implementation, review your AI-assisted changes and commit them to the main repository.

   **Example:**

   ```plaintext
   1. Complete the implementation in the "Coder" section.
   2. Select "Review Changes."
   3. Check for errors and make necessary adjustments.
   4. Click "Push to Repository" to update the main branch.
   ```

## Core Functionalities

- **Project Manager:**
  - A centralized hub for teams to oversee project progress and manage resources efficiently. It offers real-time insights into project development and AI integration, facilitating strategic decision-making.

- **Kanban:**
  - Acts as a visual representation of workflow management.
  - Helps team members track progress, prioritize tasks, and collaborate effectively.
  
  **Example of Task Transition:**

  ```plaintext
  1. Task "Design UI" is in the "To Do" column.
  2. Drag "Design UI" to "In Progress" as work begins.
  3. Once complete, move "Design UI" to "Done" to mark its completion.
  ```

## Benefits of Using Codx-Junior

- **Enhanced Collaboration:**
  Codx-Junior smoothens interactions among BU, PM, and FSD by providing a shared platform powered by an AI designed specifically for the project.

- **Efficiency and Scalability:**
  The AI-driven approach enables faster iteration and scaling of projects by automating routine tasks and offering real-time support.

- **Centralized Knowledge Base:**
  The automatic generation of a "Wiki" and "Knowledge" base ensures that all team members have access to updated information and best practices.

## Conclusion

By transforming projects into AI-driven entities, Codx-Junior offers an innovative approach to project management and development. This roadmap document illustrates how to harness the capabilities of Codx-Junior to enhance teamwork, streamline processes, and achieve project success.
