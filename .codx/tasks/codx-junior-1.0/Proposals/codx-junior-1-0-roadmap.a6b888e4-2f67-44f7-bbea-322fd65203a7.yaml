- content: "# Codx-Junior 1.0 Roadmap Document\n\n## Introduction\n\n**Codx-Junior**\
    \ is a cutting-edge AI platform designed to bridge the gap between Project Management\
    \ and Development. It allows each project to transform into its own AI entity,\
    \ assisting team members throughout the project's lifecycle. By integrating Business\
    \ Users (BU), Project Managers (PM), and Full Stack Developers (FSD) with project-specific\
    \ AIs, teams can achieve seamless collaboration on shared tasks.\n\n## How Codx-Junior\
    \ Works\n\n1. **Connecting Projects:**\n   - Link your projects using Git repositories\
    \ in the Projects section of Codx-Junior.\n   - This connection transforms your\
    \ project into an AI that can be further customized.\n\n   **Example:**\n\n  \
    \ ```plaintext\n   1. Navigate to the Projects section on Codx-Junior.\n   2.\
    \ Click on \"Connect Project.\"\n   3. Enter the URL of your Git repository.\n\
    \   4. Confirm to establish the link.\n   ```\n\n2. **Fine-Tuning Your AI:**\n\
    \   - Utilize the Profiles and Knowledge Section to fine-tune your project AI.\n\
    \   - Develop a \"Wiki\" and \"Knowledge\" base in real-time to assist your work\
    \ processes.\n\n3. **Creating and Managing Tasks:**\n   - Access the Kanban board\
    \ to create and manage tasks alongside your AI and team members.\n   - Determine\
    \ the level of detail for tasks before using the \"Coder\" feature to implement\
    \ solutions.\n\n   **Example:**\n\n   ```plaintext\n   1. Go to the Kanban board.\n\
    \   2. Click on \"Create New Task.\"\n   3. Assign a title and description.\n\
    \   4. Set priority and assignee from your team.\n   5. Save to add the task to\
    \ your board.\n   ```\n\n4. **Reviewing and Pushing Changes:**\n   - After implementation,\
    \ review your AI-assisted changes and commit them to the main repository.\n\n\
    \   **Example:**\n\n   ```plaintext\n   1. Complete the implementation in the\
    \ \"Coder\" section.\n   2. Select \"Review Changes.\"\n   3. Check for errors\
    \ and make necessary adjustments.\n   4. Click \"Push to Repository\" to update\
    \ the main branch.\n   ```\n\n## Core Functionalities\n\n- **Project Manager:**\n\
    \  - A centralized hub for teams to oversee project progress and manage resources\
    \ efficiently. It offers real-time insights into project development and AI integration,\
    \ facilitating strategic decision-making.\n\n- **Kanban:**\n  - Acts as a visual\
    \ representation of workflow management.\n  - Helps team members track progress,\
    \ prioritize tasks, and collaborate effectively.\n  \n  **Example of Task Transition:**\n\
    \n  ```plaintext\n  1. Task \"Design UI\" is in the \"To Do\" column.\n  2. Drag\
    \ \"Design UI\" to \"In Progress\" as work begins.\n  3. Once complete, move \"\
    Design UI\" to \"Done\" to mark its completion.\n  ```\n\n## Benefits of Using\
    \ Codx-Junior\n\n- **Enhanced Collaboration:**\n  Codx-Junior smoothens interactions\
    \ among BU, PM, and FSD by providing a shared platform powered by an AI designed\
    \ specifically for the project.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability:**\n  The AI-driven\
    \ approach enables faster iteration and scaling of projects by automating routine\
    \ tasks and offering real-time support.\n\n- **Centralized Knowledge Base:**\n\
    \  The automatic generation of a \"Wiki\" and \"Knowledge\" base ensures that\
    \ all team members have access to updated information and best practices.\n\n\
    ## Conclusion\n\nBy transforming projects into AI-driven entities, Codx-Junior\
    \ offers an innovative approach to project management and development. This roadmap\
    \ document illustrates how to harness the capabilities of Codx-Junior to enhance\
    \ teamwork, streamline processes, and achieve project success."
