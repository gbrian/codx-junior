We must allow relative paths for project_path and codx_path settings

Sure, allowing relative paths for `project_path` and `codx_path` can make the setup more flexible. You can implement this by resolving these paths at runtime using a method like `os.path.abspath()` in Python, which converts a relative path to an absolute path. Do you need guidance on how to implement this?
