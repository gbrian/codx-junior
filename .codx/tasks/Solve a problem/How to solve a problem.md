Okay.We are going to discuss about a flow on how to solve a problem a coding problem.In this essential area, we have a code base and we are being told that there is a problem with the response of our AP.I method check availability. 
So we are going to list all the steps that we usually locate to solve the problem like that are 
The steps to usually solve a problem are explain.The problem, create a feature for the problem and execute the test to see if the problem is solved.In case that the problem is not solved, we will be finding more information.I'm fixing again and testing again

**TASK: Documenting the Problem-Solving Process for Coding Issues**

**Objective**: To create a clear and structured guide for solving coding problems, specifically focusing on issues related to the API method `checkAvailability`.

### Problem-Solving Steps:

1. **Explain the Problem:**
   - Clearly define the issue with the `checkAvailability` method.
   - Understand the expected vs. actual response from the method.
   - Gather all relevant information and logs to diagnose the problem.

2. **Create a Feature/Plan for the Problem:**
   - Develop a strategy or plan to address the issue.
   - Identify if there's a need for a new feature or modification in the current logic.
   - Document the approach and steps needed to implement the fix.

3. **Execute Tests:**
   - Implement the changes or new feature as planned.
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the problem is resolved.
   - Use both unit tests and integration tests where applicable.

4. **Iterate if Necessary:**
   - If the problem persists, gather additional information.
   - Revisit the problem definition and plan.
   - Make necessary adjustments and retest.

5. **Final Testing and Validation:**
   - Once the issue is resolved, conduct final validation.
   - Ensure that the solution does not introduce new issues.
   - Confirm with stakeholders that the problem is fixed.

**DOUBTS:**
- Could you provide more details about the specific problem with the `checkAvailability` method? This would help in tailoring the guide more effectively.
- Are there any existing documentation or constraints that should be considered while solving this problem?

This is not about a real case.This is about listing all the steps and reflecting about the different parts.We need to consider the information we need and the elements.We will need all the parts we will need to repeat if a and step is failing

### Contextual Information
- Setting up and running a FastAPI application can be crucial for diagnosing and fixing issues. Key steps include setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and running the application with uvicorn.
- A detailed setup guide and Dockerfile are available, which highlight necessary steps to ensure the application runs correctly and can be repeated if any step fails.

**DOUBTS:**
- Could you provide more details about the specific problem with the `checkAvailability` method? This would help in tailoring the guide more effectively.
- Are there any existing documentation or constraints that should be considered while solving this problem? 
- Is there a preferred testing framework or environment that should be used for testing the `checkAvailability` method?
