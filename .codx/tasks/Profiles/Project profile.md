Here's an updated version of your JSON file with standard generic best practices for a client-server architecture:

```json
{
  "name": "project",
  "description": "",
  "category": "",
  "file_match": "",
  "content": {
    "client_server_best_practices": {
      "separation_of_concerns": "Ensure clear separation between client and server logic.",
      "stateless_server": "Design server to be stateless; use tokens to maintain session state.",
      "security": "Implement authentication and authorization. Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.",
      "scalability": "Design for horizontal scaling by adding more instances of servers.",
      "caching": "Use caching to improve performance and reduce server load.",
      "error_handling": "Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.",
      "api_versioning": "Use versioning in APIs to manage changes without breaking clients.",

This includes general best practices for a robust client-server architecture.

Here's the updated JSON file with a markdown-based content section including standard generic best practices for client-server architecture:

```json
{
  "name": "project",
  "description": "",
  "category": "",
  "file_match": "",
  "content": "# Client-Server Architecture Best Practices\n\n## Separation of Concerns\nEnsure clear separation between client and server logic.\n\n## Stateless Server\nDesign server to be stateless; use tokens to maintain session state.\n\n## Security\nImplement authentication and authorization.
