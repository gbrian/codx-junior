Certainly! To refine the document based on the provided comments and ensure it aligns with the specified template, here's a structured representation of the intended document:

```md
**Objective:**
- Develop a global profiles gallery that any project can override and create a profiles marketplace where users can connect with profiles.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a global profiles gallery.
- Ensure capability for any project to override this gallery.
- Develop a profiles marketplace.
- Facilitate user connections with profiles.

**Examples:**
- Use cases of how a project might override the global profiles gallery.
- Scenarios illustrating user interaction within the profiles marketplace.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A working global profiles gallery allows projects to override.
- [ ] A functioning profiles marketplace is accessible to users.
- [ ] Users are able to connect with and engage profiles.
- [ ] Profiles are categorized into flow profiles and file-based profiles.
  - Flow profiles include:
    - task_analyst: Instructs on assisting users in defining tasks.
    - task_agent: Guides the execution of multi-step tasks.
  - File-based profiles include:
    - file_writing: Establishes rules for writing specific files based on name and path.
    - file_analysis: Explains how to interpret a file for indexing or creating a wiki.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider scalability and flexibility of the global profiles gallery to accommodate various projects.
- Ensure user privacy and data protection in the profiles marketplace.
- Search queries to be possibly included:
  - global profiles gallery
  - profiles marketplace
  - flow profiles
  - file-based profiles
  - task_analyst
  - task_agent
  - file_writing
  - file_analysis
```

This refined document provides a clear and structured format that outlines the task's key components in line with user inputs and comments.
