- content: "Certainly! To refine the document based on the provided comments and ensure\
    \ it aligns with the specified template, here's a structured representation of\
    \ the intended document:\n\n```md\n**Objective:**\n- Develop a global profiles\
    \ gallery that any project can override and create a profiles marketplace where\
    \ users can connect with profiles.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Implement a global\
    \ profiles gallery.\n- Ensure capability for any project to override this gallery.\n\
    - Develop a profiles marketplace.\n- Facilitate user connections with profiles.\n\
    \n**Examples:**\n- Use cases of how a project might override the global profiles\
    \ gallery.\n- Scenarios illustrating user interaction within the profiles marketplace.\n\
    \n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] A working global profiles gallery allows projects\
    \ to override.\n- [ ] A functioning profiles marketplace is accessible to users.\n\
    - [ ] Users are able to connect with and engage profiles.\n- [ ] Profiles are\
    \ categorized into flow profiles and file-based profiles.\n  - Flow profiles include:\n\
    \    - task_analyst: Instructs on assisting users in defining tasks.\n    - task_agent:\
    \ Guides the execution of multi-step tasks.\n  - File-based profiles include:\n\
    \    - file_writing: Establishes rules for writing specific files based on name\
    \ and path.\n    - file_analysis: Explains how to interpret a file for indexing\
    \ or creating a wiki.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Consider scalability and flexibility\
    \ of the global profiles gallery to accommodate various projects.\n- Ensure user\
    \ privacy and data protection in the profiles marketplace.\n- Search queries to\
    \ be possibly included:\n  - global profiles gallery\n  - profiles marketplace\n\
    \  - flow profiles\n  - file-based profiles\n  - task_analyst\n  - task_agent\n\
    \  - file_writing\n  - file_analysis\n```\n\nThis refined document provides a\
    \ clear and structured format that outlines the task's key components in line\
    \ with user inputs and comments."
