- content: 'To fulfill the user''s request regarding the definition and constraint
    of AI behavior through profiles in codx-junior, we can structure a task using
    the provided template. Below is the crafted task definition:


    ```md

    **Objective:**

    - Define profiles in codx-junior to constrain AI behavior in specific parts of
    the workflow, such as chat, analysis, code improvement, and file validation.


    **Requirements:**

    - Profiles should be able to enforce specific coding styles, project requirements,
    and team guidelines.

    - Profiles must be customizable to suit different projects or scenarios.

    - Ensure the AI adheres to the defined profiles during its operations.


    **Examples:**

    - A profile that enforces a particular code style and automatically updates documentation
    after code changes.

    - A profile that validates code changes against predefined criteria before acceptance.


    **Acceptance Criteria:**

    - [ ] Profiles can be created, edited, and deleted by users.

    - [ ] AI behavior changes according to the activated profile settings.

    - [ ] Successful enforcement of coding standards and guidelines as defined in
    the profiles.

    - [ ] Documentation is automatically updated post code changes when applicable.

    - [ ] Validation checks are performed as per the profile settings before code
    is accepted.


    **Additional Notes:**

    - Profiles provide a mechanism for maintaining consistency and quality across
    software development processes.

    - Consideration should be given to how profiles interact with existing features
    like knowledge management and task processing.

    ```


    This structured task definition ensures that developers clearly understand the
    objective and requirements, and it provides a checklist to determine successful
    completion.'
