Introducing "conversations" a new chat mode.
In the conversation mode the first message defines the conversation topic.
Then we can add participants to the chat (in the chat definition) or eventually mention other users them.
When a new message is sent, participants (chat or mentioned) can answer.

That sounds like an exciting new feature! Let's structure this concept into different components and possibly write some basic code to represent how this feature can be implemented.

**1. Chat Initialization:**
- Start a conversation by defining a topic.
- Specify participants upon creation or as the conversation progresses.

```json /chats/conversation_template.json
{
  "topic": "New Feature Discussion",
  "participants": [
    "Alice",
    "Bob"
  ],
  "messages": []
}
```

**2. Adding Participants:**
- Allow adding participants at the start or later.

```json /chats/add_participant.json
{
  "action": "add_participant",
  "chat_id": "123456",
  "participant": "Charlie"
}
```

**3. Sending Messages:**
- When a message is sent, notify both chat participants and mentioned users.

```json /chats/send_message.json
{
  "chat_id": "123456",
  "from": "Alice",
  "message": "Hello, @Bob and @Charlie, what do you think about this feature?",
  "mentions": [
    "Bob",
    "Charlie"
  ]
}
```

**4. Replying to Messages:**
- Anyone mentioned or participating in the chat can reply.

```json /chats/reply_message.json
{
  "chat_id": "123456",
  "from": "Bob",
  "message": "I think it's a great idea. We should also consider security aspects."
}
```

This approach gives structure to the conversation mode feature, defining participants, how messages are sent, and how participants are notified or added. Further development can manage real-time notifications, user interface elements, and integrating with other chat functionalities.
