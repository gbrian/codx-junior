Based on your request to profile the 'codx-junior' app endpoints using PyCharm, here is a task definition that outlines the necessary steps to achieve this goal:

```md
### Profile CODX-Junior App Endpoints

**Objective:**
- Utilize PyCharm's profiling tools to analyze the performance of the 'codx-junior' FastAPI application endpoints. The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks, measure response times, and optimize resource usage.

**Requirements:**
- Have PyCharm Professional Edition installed, as it includes the necessary profiling tools.
- Access to the 'codx-junior' application codebase.
- Necessary permissions to run the application locally or in an environment where profiling is possible.
- Ensure that the application dependencies are correctly installed and the environment is configured (e.g., Python, FastAPI, dependencies in `requirements.txt`).

**Examples:**
- Profile the `/api/health` endpoint to measure response time and memory usage.
- Analyze the middleware `add_process_time_header` for any added overhead.
- Evaluate the impact of background processes like `check_all_projects_loop` on the overall application performance.
- Profile the Socket.IO connection handlers to assess the application's real-time performance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A detailed profiling report generated by PyCharm that includes insights on response times, memory consumption, and CPU usage for each profiled endpoint.
- Identification of any performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the application.
- Recommendations or implemented changes to optimize endpoint performance based on profiling data.

**Additional Notes:**
- Profiling should be conducted in a controlled environment to ensure accurate measurement. Consider using a staging environment if available.
- Pay special attention to exception handlers like `my_exception_handler` and background tasks that could affect application responsiveness.
- Document any changes made to the codebase as a result of the profiling process, and ensure they are tested for stability and performance improvements.
