    ```md

    ### Profile CODX-Junior App Endpoints


    **Objective:**

    - Utilize PyCharm''s profiling tools to analyze the performance of the ''codx-junior''
    FastAPI application endpoints. The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks,
    measure response times, and optimize resource usage.


    **Requirements:**

    - Have PyCharm Professional Edition installed, as it includes the necessary profiling
    tools.

    - Access to the ''codx-junior'' application codebase.

    - Necessary permissions to run the application locally or in an environment where
    profiling is possible.

    - Ensure that the application dependencies are correctly installed and the environment
    is configured (e.g., Python, FastAPI, dependencies in `requirements.txt`).


    **Examples:**

    - Profile the `/api/health` endpoint to measure response time and memory usage.

    - Analyze the middleware `add_process_time_header` for any added overhead.

    - Evaluate the impact of background processes like `check_all_projects_loop` on
    the overall application performance.

    - Profile the Socket.IO connection handlers to assess the application''s real-time
    performance.


    **Acceptance Criteria:**

    - A detailed profiling report generated by PyCharm that includes insights on response
    times, memory consumption, and CPU usage for each profiled endpoint.

    - Identification of any performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the application.

    - Recommendations or implemented changes to optimize endpoint performance based
    on profiling data.


    **Additional Notes:**

    - Profiling should be conducted in a controlled environment to ensure accurate
    measurement. Consider using a staging environment if available.

    - Pay special attention to exception handlers like `my_exception_handler` and
    background tasks that could affect application responsiveness.

    - Document any changes made to the codebase as a result of the profiling process,
    and ensure they are tested for stability and performance improvements.

    ```


    This task definition should guide you in setting up and executing a profiling
    session for the ''codx-junior'' app using PyCharm. Let me know if there are any
    adjustments or additional details you need!'
