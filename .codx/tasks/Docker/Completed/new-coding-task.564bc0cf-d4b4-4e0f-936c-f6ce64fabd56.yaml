    we create the codx-junior user in the entrypoint.

    Create bash script to check if /home/codx-junior folder exists and if not:

- content: "You can create a bash script that checks for the existence of the `/home/codx-junior`\
    \ directory, and if it does not exist, creates the user `codx-junior` with the\
    \ specified `USER_UID` and `USER_GID`. Here's a script that does exactly that:\n\
    \n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if USER_UID and USER_GID are set; otherwise,\
    \ use default value 1000\nUSER_UID=${USER_UID:-1000}\nUSER_GID=${USER_GID:-1000}\n\
    USERNAME=\"codx-junior\"\nHOME_DIR=\"/home/$USERNAME\"\n\n# Check if home directory\
    \ exists\nif [ ! -d \"$HOME_DIR\" ]; then\n    echo \"Creating user $USERNAME\
    \ with UID:$USER_UID and GID:$USER_GID\"\n\n    # Create group if it doesn't exist\n\
    \    if ! getent group $USER_GID > /dev/null 2>&1; then\n        groupadd -g $USER_GID\
    \ $USERNAME\n    fi\n\n    # Create user with specified UID and GID\n    useradd\
    \ -m -u $USER_UID -g $USER_GID -s /bin/bash -d $HOME_DIR $USERNAME\n\n    # Add\
    \ user to sudoers with no password\n    echo \"$USERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\"\
    \ >> /etc/sudoers\n\n    echo \"User $USERNAME created with home directory at\
    \ $HOME_DIR\"\nelse\n    echo \"User $USERNAME already exists with home directory\
    \ at $HOME_DIR\"\nfi\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Environment Variables**:\
    \ The script uses `USER_UID` and `USER_GID` from the environment variables. If\
    \ they are not set, defaults to `1000`.\n\n2. **Check Home Directory**: It checks\
    \ if the `/home/codx-junior` directory exists.\n\n3. **Group Creation**: The script\
    \ ensures the group associated with the user doesn't already exist. If the group\
    \ with the specified `USER_GID` does not exist, it creates one.\n\n4. **User Creation**:\
    \ It creates a new user with the specified or default UID, GID, no password, and\
    \ sets their shell to `/bin/bash`.\n\n5. **Sudo Setup**: The user is granted passwordless\
    \ sudo access by appending the appropriate permissions to the `/etc/sudoers` file.\n\
    \n6. **Feedback**: Provides feedback on whether the user was created or already\
    \ exists.\n\n### Usage\n\n- Save this script in your Docker container, perhaps\
    \ in `/usr/local/bin/setup-user.sh`.\n- Make sure the script is executable: `chmod\
    \ +x /usr/local/bin/setup-user.sh`.\n- You can run this script from your `Dockerfile`\
    \ or set it as your container entrypoint.\n\nNote: Ensure your Docker container\
    \ has the necessary permissions to modify user accounts and the `/etc/sudoers`\
    \ file. This typically requires running the container with elevated privileges."
