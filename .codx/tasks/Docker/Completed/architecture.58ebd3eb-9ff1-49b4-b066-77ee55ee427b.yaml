- content: "The architecture for codx-junior based on Docker containers involves organizing\
    \ several components to create a development environment optimized for collaboration\
    \ and isolation. This setup offers flexibility for teams to work on projects simultaneously\
    \ while maintaining separate and personalized workspaces. Here is an explanation\
    \ of the architecture and how it functions, along with a mermaid diagram to visualize\
    \ the setup:\n\n### Components Overview\n\n1. **codx-junior-workspace**: This\
    \ is the base Docker image that contains essential development tools. It can be\
    \ extended to include more tools and technologies required for specific projects.\n\
    \n2. **project-workspace**: This is an extended version of `codx-junior-workspace`,\
    \ containing all the additional technologies and tools specific to a project.\n\
    \n3. **project-folder**: A directory that contains all of the project's files.\
    \ This is the main repository where project data is stored.\n\n4. **user-project-folder**:\
    \ Each team member has their own copy of the project-folder for working independently,\
    \ preventing conflicts and keeping development isolated.\n\n5. **user-workspace**:\
    \ It is a Docker container instance running the `project-workspace` setup for\
    \ each user, linked to their respective `user-project-folder`.\n\n6. **codx-junior-api**:\
    \ This is a shared API service that allows interaction with the project data and\
    \ integrates AI functionalities, managing access to project data via a `users.json`\
    \ permission file.\n\n7. **codx-junior-llm-factory**: Provides a private environment\
    \ for running AI models, ensuring that private and sensitive data remains secure.\n\
    \n### Typical Setup for a 2-Member Team\n\nFor a team of two members, the setup\
    \ would consist of:\n\n- One instance of **codx-junior-api**, which oversees all\
    \ project folders and manages user permissions.\n- One instance of **codx-junior-llm-factory**\
    \ for handling AI models.\n- Two instances of **user-workspace**, each associated\
    \ with the corresponding **user-project-folder**.\n- The `users.json` file is\
    \ configured to set permissions for access and interactions with the projects.\n\
    \n### Mermaid Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    subgraph Users\n        UWF1(User\
    \ 1 Workspace)\n        UWF2(User 2 Workspace)\n    end\n    subgraph Workspaces\n\
    \        PWF1[user-project-folder 1]\n        PWF2[user-project-folder 2]\n  \
    \  end\n    subgraph Project-Folder\n        PF[Project-Folder]\n    end\n   \
    \ subgraph API-LLM\n        CJAPI[codx-junior-api]\n        CJLLM[codx-junior-llm-factory]\n\
    \    end\n    \n    UWF1 -- uses --> PWF1\n    UWF2 -- uses --> PWF2\n    PWF1\
    \ --> PF\n    PWF2 --> PF\n    \n    CJAPI <---> PF\n    CJAPI <---> CJLLM\n \
    \   \n    classDef box fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\n    Users, Workspaces,\
    \ Project-Folder, API-LLM class box;\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Users**: Each\
    \ user has a `user-workspace` running an instance of `project-workspace`, which\
    \ is personalized for project-specific needs.\n\n- **Workspaces**: The `user-project-folder`\
    \ is a working copy of the main project-folder. Each user workspace has its own\
    \ separate copy to avoid conflicts.\n\n- **Project-Folder**: The centralized location\
    \ where project files are stored and can be updated from user-project-folders\
    \ as needed.\n\n- **API-LLM**: The `codx-junior-api` manages interactions and\
    \ permissions via `users.json`, while `codx-junior-llm-factory` ensures private\
    \ models are executed separately.\n\nThis architecture ensures a flexible and\
    \ secure environment for collaboration on complex projects, scalable to more users\
    \ or projects as necessary."

- content: "I'll provide the updated diagram with the given Mermaid code. Here it\
    \ is:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    subgraph Users\n        UWF1(User 1 Workspace)\n\

    \ <---> PF\n    CJAPI <---> CJLLM\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Users and Workspaces**:\
    \ Each user (User 1 and User 2) has their own workspace, `UWF1` and `UWF2`, which\
    \ are instances of `user-workspace` based on `project-workspace`.\n\n- **Workspaces\
    \ and Project-Folder**: Users work on their individual `user-project-folder`,\
    \ `PWF1` and `PWF2`, which can sync changes to the main `project-folder` (PF).\n\
    \n- **API-LLM**: The `codx-junior-api` (CJAPI) manages all interactions with the\
    \ `Project-Folder` (PF) and integrates with the `codx-junior-llm-factory` (CJLLM)\
    \ to support AI model operations.\n\nThis setup diagrams how different components\
    \ interact within the architecture, facilitating secure, isolated, and collaborative\
    \ development environments."
