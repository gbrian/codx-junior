We are running codx-junior in docker. We need to match host user uid so we create the codx-junior user in the entrypoint.
Create bash script to check if /home/codx-junior folder exists and if not:
* create codx-junior user with $USER_UID and $USER_GID (or 1000) with home, no password and add to sudoers

You can create a bash script that checks for the existence of the `/home/codx-junior` directory, and if it does not exist, creates the user `codx-junior` with the specified `USER_UID` and `USER_GID`. Here's a script that does exactly that:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if USER_UID and USER_GID are set; otherwise, use default value 1000
USER_UID=${USER_UID:-1000}
USER_GID=${USER_GID:-1000}
USERNAME="codx-junior"
HOME_DIR="/home/$USERNAME"

# Check if home directory exists
if [ ! -d "$HOME_DIR" ]; then
    echo "Creating user $USERNAME with UID:$USER_UID and GID:$USER_GID"

    # Create group if it doesn't exist
    if ! getent group $USER_GID > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        groupadd -g $USER_GID $USERNAME
    fi

    # Create user with specified UID and GID
    useradd -m -u $USER_UID -g $USER_GID -s /bin/bash -d $HOME_DIR $USERNAME

    # Add user to sudoers with no password
    echo "$USERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

    echo "User $USERNAME created with home directory at $HOME_DIR"
else
    echo "User $USERNAME already exists with home directory at $HOME_DIR"
fi
```

### Explanation

1. **Environment Variables**: The script uses `USER_UID` and `USER_GID` from the environment variables. If they are not set, defaults to `1000`.

2. **Check Home Directory**: It checks if the `/home/codx-junior` directory exists.

3. **Group Creation**: The script ensures the group associated with the user doesn't already exist. If the group with the specified `USER_GID` does not exist, it creates one.

4. **User Creation**: It creates a new user with the specified or default UID, GID, no password, and sets their shell to `/bin/bash`.

5. **Sudo Setup**: The user is granted passwordless sudo access by appending the appropriate permissions to the `/etc/sudoers` file.

6. **Feedback**: Provides feedback on whether the user was created or already exists.

### Usage

- Save this script in your Docker container, perhaps in `/usr/local/bin/setup-user.sh`.
- Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/setup-user.sh`.
- You can run this script from your `Dockerfile` or set it as your container entrypoint.

Note: Ensure your Docker container has the necessary permissions to modify user accounts and the `/etc/sudoers` file. This typically requires running the container with elevated privileges.
