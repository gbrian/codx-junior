I want to update motivation in README with this comments:

As a Full Stack Developer we are supposed to deal with everything, know everything and fix everithng... from ftont, to back, to database, cloud, devops... and I like it but... is a titan task.
I'm developing codx-junior to have an AI able to manage all tedious and repetitive tasks in software development and IT .
I want codx-junior to help me dealing with project's I don't know and "the last developer left yesterday and there's no doc".
I want codx-junior to write better code than me, better tests than me and ofc keep documentation updated.
