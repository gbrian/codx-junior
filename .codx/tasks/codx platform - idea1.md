Help me preparing a brief and clear introduction about "codx" (keep it  lower):
I want codx to be a platform where people and companies can publish code issues from open source repositories and set a price to get people fixing them.
Anyone can add money to existing tickets like crowdfunding.
Then registered users can take the jobs and developed them using the AI ready codespace: codx-junior.
Registered users can tune their codx-junior with their prompts to make it more performant and make codx-junior work for them.
You get paid when your PR is merged
