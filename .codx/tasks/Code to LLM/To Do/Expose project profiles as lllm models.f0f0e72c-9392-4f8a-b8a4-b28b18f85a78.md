We can expose Project's profiles as chatGPT compatible chat models.
We need a chatGPT completions endpoit and model names will be project-name:profile

In this way any other project or 3rd party tools can use our customised models.

It will go like this:
* POST request to completion endpoint
* Check auth if applies
* Extract project and profile from "model name"
* We use chat_with_project with process user request
* create a response

**Task: Expose Project Profiles as LLM Models**

**Document:**

To enable the usage of project-specific profiles as chatGPT-compatible models, we propose the following framework:

1. **ChatGPT Completions Endpoint:**
   - Establish a completions endpoint that aligns with chatGPT standards to handle POST requests.

2. **Model Naming Convention:**
   - Each model will be identified by the format `project-name:profile`. This allows differentiation between various project profiles and ensures that specific customizations are accessible via clearly defined model names.

3. **Integration with External Tools:**
   - By using this approach, any external project or third-party tool can leverage our tailored models effectively.

4. **Process Flow:**
   - **POST Request Handling:** Incoming requests to the completions endpoint will be processed via a POST method.
   - **Authentication:** Implement authentication mechanisms if applicable to ensure secure access.
   - **Model Name Parsing:** From the provided model name, extract relevant project and profile information.
   - **Customized Response Generation:**
     - Employ the `chat_with_project` function to process the user's request.
     - Generate a relevant response based on the project-specific profile.
   
This strategy ensures that the distinct profiles within each project can be seamlessly integrated as chat models, enhancing flexibility and providing tailored interactions.
