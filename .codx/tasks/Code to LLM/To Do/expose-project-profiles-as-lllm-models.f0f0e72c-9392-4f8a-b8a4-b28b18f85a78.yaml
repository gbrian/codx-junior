- content: 'We can expose Project''s profiles as chatGPT compatible chat models.

    We need a chatGPT completions endpoit and model names will be project-name:profile


    In this way any other project or 3rd party tools can use our customised models.


    It will go like this:

    * POST request to completion endpoint

    * Check auth if applies

    * Extract project and profile from "model name"

    * We use chat_with_project with process user request

    * create a response'

- content: "Here's a refined version of the document based on the provided comments:\n\
    \n---\n\n**Task: Expose Project Profiles as LLM Models**\n\n**Document:**\n\n\
    To enable the usage of project-specific profiles as chatGPT-compatible models,\
    \ we propose the following framework:\n\n1. **ChatGPT Completions Endpoint:**\n\
    \   - Establish a completions endpoint that aligns with chatGPT standards to handle\
    \ POST requests.\n\n2. **Model Naming Convention:**\n   - Each model will be identified\
    \ by the format `project-name:profile`. This allows differentiation between various\
    \ project profiles and ensures that specific customizations are accessible via\
    \ clearly defined model names.\n\n3. **Integration with External Tools:**\n  \
    \ - By using this approach, any external project or third-party tool can leverage\
    \ our tailored models effectively.\n\n4. **Process Flow:**\n   - **POST Request\
    \ Handling:** Incoming requests to the completions endpoint will be processed\
    \ via a POST method.\n   - **Authentication:** Implement authentication mechanisms\
    \ if applicable to ensure secure access.\n   - **Model Name Parsing:** From the\
    \ provided model name, extract relevant project and profile information.\n   -\
    \ **Customized Response Generation:**\n     - Employ the `chat_with_project` function\
    \ to process the user's request.\n     - Generate a relevant response based on\
    \ the project-specific profile.\n   \nThis strategy ensures that the distinct\
    \ profiles within each project can be seamlessly integrated as chat models, enhancing\
    \ flexibility and providing tailored interactions.\n\n--- \n\nThis document provides\
    \ a concise overview of how project profiles can be exposed as chatGPT-compatible\
    \ models, while ensuring secure and effective usage by external entities."
