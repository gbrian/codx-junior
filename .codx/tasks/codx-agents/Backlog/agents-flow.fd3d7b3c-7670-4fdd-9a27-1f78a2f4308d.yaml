    **Objective:**

    - Develop a codx-agent named codx-dev, capable of autonomously writing code to
    fulfill assigned tasks.


    **Requirements:**

    - codx-dev should be able to interpret task descriptions and requirements.

    - It should be proficient in various programming languages and frameworks.

    - The agent must include debugging capabilities.

    - Ensure codx-dev can version control the code it produces.

    - codx-dev should provide documentation for the code it generates.


    **Examples:**

    - Example 1: Task - "Create a RESTful API in Python." codx-dev should analyze
    the task, choose the appropriate libraries (e.g., Flask or Django), and code the
    API endpoints.

    - Example 2: Task - "Develop a web scraper using JavaScript." codx-dev should
    select tools like Puppeteer or Cheerio and implement the scraper accordingly.


    **Acceptance Criteria:**

    - [ ] codx-dev successfully interprets and executes tasks as intended.

    - [ ] The code produced is functional and free from errors.

    - [ ] Documentation is complete and understandable.

    - [ ] The code is properly version-controlled.

    - [ ] The agent demonstrates proficiency in selected programming languages and
    frameworks.

    - [ ] Debugging capabilities are effective and reliable.


    **Additional Notes:**

    - Consider implementing a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement of codx-dev.

    - Evaluate the ethical implications of autonomous code generation and ensure compliance
    with relevant guidelines.

- content: "Based on the provided information, here is a refined task definition for\
    \ the development of a codx-agent as part of the @codx-api project, implementing\
    \ the user's requirements:\n\n```md\n**Objective:**\n- Develop a codx-agent in\
    \ Python that integrates with the @codx-api to autonomously handle tasks related\
    \ to code development, testing, and user interaction.\n\n**Requirements:**\n-\
    \ The codx-agent must be able to:\n  - Use chat functionalities to request and\
    \ manage user feedback.\n  - Search for existing code within the project repository\
    \ efficiently.\n  - Execute test files to ensure code integrity and functionality.\n\
    \  - Write and modify code in the project, implementing requested changes autonomously.\n\
    - Implement version control for any code changes made by the agent.\n- Provide\
    \ documentation for all generated code and changes.\n- Include debugging capabilities\
    \ to handle errors and ensure reliability.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Example 1: Use\
    \ the chat tool to gather user feedback on a recent code change and integrate\
    \ that feedback into the project.\n- Example 2: Search the project repository\
    \ for a specific function to determine if a similar implementation already exists.\n\
    - Example 3: Execute a test suite to validate recent changes and ensure no regressions\
    \ have occurred.\n- Example 4: Write a new module in Python for data processing\
    \ based on provided specifications.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] The codx-agent\
    \ successfully integrates with the @codx-api and performs all assigned tasks autonomously.\n\
    - [ ] Chat functionality is implemented and allows for effective user feedback\
    \ management.\n- [ ] Search capabilities are efficient and accurate in finding\
    \ existing code.\n- [ ] The agent can execute and report on test files.\n- [ ]\
    \ Code writing and modification functionalities are reliable and meet project\
    \ requirements.\n- [ ] All code is version-controlled and documented.\n- [ ] Debugging\
    \ features are present and operational.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Consider implementing\
    \ a feedback loop for continuous improvement of the codx-agent.\n- Adhere to ethical\
    \ guidelines regarding autonomous code generation and user interaction.\n```\n\
    \nThis template is updated to align with the user's requirements and provides\
    \ a clear framework for developing the codx-agent, ensuring all aspects are covered\
    \ comprehensively.null"
