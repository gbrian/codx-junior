We must define codx-dev: a codx-agent.
A software engineer coding llm agent able to develop code.
User will assign it to a task and codx-dev will go throught different steps to accomplish the task.

**Objective:**
- Develop a codx-agent named codx-dev, capable of autonomously writing code to fulfill assigned tasks.

**Requirements:**
- codx-dev should be able to interpret task descriptions and requirements.
- It should be proficient in various programming languages and frameworks.
- The agent must include debugging capabilities.
- Ensure codx-dev can version control the code it produces.
- codx-dev should provide documentation for the code it generates.

**Examples:**
- Example 1: Task - "Create a RESTful API in Python." codx-dev should analyze the task, choose the appropriate libraries (e.g., Flask or Django), and code the API endpoints.
- Example 2: Task - "Develop a web scraper using JavaScript." codx-dev should select tools like Puppeteer or Cheerio and implement the scraper accordingly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] codx-dev successfully interprets and executes tasks as intended.
- [ ] The code produced is functional and free from errors.
- [ ] Documentation is complete and understandable.
- [ ] The code is properly version-controlled.
- [ ] The agent demonstrates proficiency in selected programming languages and frameworks.
- [ ] Debugging capabilities are effective and reliable.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider implementing a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement of codx-dev.
- Evaluate the ethical implications of autonomous code generation and ensure compliance with relevant guidelines.

A codx-agent will make part of @codx-api and will be implented in python.
Will be able to use different tools like: 
 * chat: To request user feedback
 * search: To find for existing code
 * test: to execute a test file
 * code: To write/ change code in the project

Based on the provided information, here is a refined task definition for the development of a codx-agent as part of the @codx-api project, implementing the user's requirements:

```md
**Objective:**
- Develop a codx-agent in Python that integrates with the @codx-api to autonomously handle tasks related to code development, testing, and user interaction.

**Requirements:**
- The codx-agent must be able to:
  - Use chat functionalities to request and manage user feedback.
  - Search for existing code within the project repository efficiently.
  - Execute test files to ensure code integrity and functionality.
  - Write and modify code in the project, implementing requested changes autonomously.
- Implement version control for any code changes made by the agent.
- Provide documentation for all generated code and changes.
- Include debugging capabilities to handle errors and ensure reliability.

**Examples:**
- Example 1: Use the chat tool to gather user feedback on a recent code change and integrate that feedback into the project.
- Example 2: Search the project repository for a specific function to determine if a similar implementation already exists.
- Example 3: Execute a test suite to validate recent changes and ensure no regressions have occurred.
- Example 4: Write a new module in Python for data processing based on provided specifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The codx-agent successfully integrates with the @codx-api and performs all assigned tasks autonomously.
- [ ] Chat functionality is implemented and allows for effective user feedback management.
- [ ] Search capabilities are efficient and accurate in finding existing code.
- [ ] The agent can execute and report on test files.
- [ ] Code writing and modification functionalities are reliable and meet project requirements.
- [ ] All code is version-controlled and documented.
- [ ] Debugging features are present and operational.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider implementing a feedback loop for continuous improvement of the codx-agent.
- Adhere to ethical guidelines regarding autonomous code generation and user interaction.
