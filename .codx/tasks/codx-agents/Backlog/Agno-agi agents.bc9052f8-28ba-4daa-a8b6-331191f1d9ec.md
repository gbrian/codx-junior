To refine the document according to the user comments, we will incorporate the example provided and ensure all tasks align with the structured template, focusing on clarity, example inclusion, and precise objective setting. Below is the refined version based on your input:

```md
**Objective:**
- Develop and enhance agents within the agno-agi framework to effectively meet user-defined goals.

**Requirements:**
- Integrate specific agent functionalities, such as web information retrieval and financial data analysis, using components like DuckDuckGoTools and YFinanceTools.
- Ensure each agent is created with clear roles and integrated using the OpenAIChat model (gpt-4o).

**Examples:**
- Example of setting up agents:
  ```python
  from agno.agent import Agent
  from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
  from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
  from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

  web_agent = Agent(
      name="Web Agent",
      role="Search the web for information",
      model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
      tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
      instructions="Always include sources",
      show_tool_calls=True,
      markdown=True,
  )

  finance_agent = Agent(
      name="Finance Agent",
      role="Get financial data",
      model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
      tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
      instructions="Use tables to display data",
      show_tool_calls=True,
      markdown=True,
  )
  ```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Successfully implement agents according to the examples provided.
- [ ] Validate that agents are capable of fulfilling their roles with clear outputs.
- [ ] Agents must incorporate source citations and use tables where applicable.

**Additional Notes:**
- Coordinate the agents using the `AgentTeam` structure for tasks requiring combined functionalities.
- Regular updates should reflect user feedback for continuous improvement of agent functionalities.
- Success criteria involve producing comprehensive and data-driven reports based on agent outputs.
```

This document now aligns with establishing well-defined agent roles, using the OpenAIChat model, and providing templates and examples to facilitate understanding. The structure ensures tasks are actionable and measureable, incorporating user feedback effectively.
