Here's a structured task definition based on your request, using the provided template and incorporating Mermaid diagrams to explain the codx-dev flow:

```md
**Objective:**
- To understand and visualize the codx-dev flow, including the main flow, user interaction, tool usage, and testing of new generated code using Mermaid diagrams.

**Requirements:**
- Familiarity with Mermaid syntax for diagram creation.
- Access to tools that support Mermaid diagrams rendering.
- Understanding of the codx-dev operational processes.

**Examples:**
- Main Flow:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A[Start] --> B[Development];
      B --> C[Code Review];
      C --> D[Integration];
      D --> E[Deployment];
      E --> F[End];
  ```
- User Interaction:
  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
      participant User
      participant System
      User->>System: Request Feature
      System-->>User: Provide Feedback
      User->>System: Submit Code
      System-->>User: Confirm Submission
  ```
- Tool Usage:
  ```mermaid
  graph LR;
      ToolA[IDE] --> ToolB[Version Control];
      ToolB --> ToolC[CI/CD Pipeline];
      ToolC --> ToolD[Monitoring Tools];
  ```
- Testing of New Generated Code:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD;
      A[Write Tests] --> B[Run Tests];
      B --> C{Tests Passed?};
      C -->|Yes| D[Merge Code];
      C -->|No| E[Fix Issues];
      E --> B;
  ```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The diagrams accurately represent the main flow of codx-dev.
- [ ] User interaction is clearly depicted.
- [ ] Tool usage is correctly illustrated.
- [ ] Testing procedures for new code are effectively demonstrated.
- [ ] All diagrams are rendered correctly and are easy to understand.

**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that diagrams are kept up to date with any changes in the codx-dev process.
- Consider using online Mermaid editors for easier diagram creation and sharing.
- Collaborate with team members to validate the accuracy of the diagrams and gather feedback.
```

This structured task definition provides clear guidance for understanding and visualizing the codx-dev flow using Mermaid diagrams, with a focus on clarity and completeness.null
