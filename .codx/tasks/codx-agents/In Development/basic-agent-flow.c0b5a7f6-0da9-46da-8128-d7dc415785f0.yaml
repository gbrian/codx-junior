- content: "To refine the document and add a basic coding agent flow with mermaid\
    \ diagrams, we can start by structuring the task definition using the provided\
    \ template. We'll also integrate mermaid diagrams to visually represent the agent's\
    \ flow. Here's a refined version incorporating these elements:\n\n```md\n**Objective:**\n\
    - Develop a codx-agent in Python that integrates with the @codx-api to autonomously\
    \ handle tasks related to code development, testing, and user interaction.\n\n\
    **Requirements:**\n- The codx-agent must be able to:\n  - Use chat functionalities\
    \ to request and manage user feedback.\n  - Search for existing code within the\
    \ project repository efficiently.\n  - Execute test files to ensure code integrity\
    \ and functionality.\n  - Write and modify code in the project, implementing requested\
    \ changes autonomously.\n  - Implement version control for any code changes made\
    \ by the agent.\n  - Provide documentation for all generated code and changes.\n\
    \  - Include debugging capabilities to handle errors and ensure reliability.\n\
    \n**Examples:**\n- Example 1: Use the chat tool to gather user feedback on a recent\
    \ code change and integrate that feedback into the project.\n- Example 2: Search\
    \ the project repository for a specific function to determine if a similar implementation\
    \ already exists.\n- Example 3: Execute a test suite to validate recent changes\
    \ and ensure no regressions have occurred.\n- Example 4: Write a new module in\
    \ Python for data processing based on provided specifications.\n\n**Acceptance\
    \ Criteria:**\n- [ ] The codx-agent successfully integrates with the @codx-api\
    \ and performs all assigned tasks autonomously.\n- [ ] Chat functionality is implemented\
    \ and allows for effective user feedback management.\n- [ ] Search capabilities\
    \ are efficient and accurate in finding existing code.\n- [ ] The agent can execute\
    \ and report on test files.\n- [ ] Code writing and modification functionalities\
    \ are reliable and meet project requirements.\n- [ ] All code is version-controlled\
    \ and documented.\n- [ ] Debugging features are present and operational.\n\n**Additional\
    \ Notes:**\n- Consider implementing a feedback loop for continuous improvement\
    \ of the codx-agent.\n- Adhere to ethical guidelines regarding autonomous code\
    \ generation and user interaction.\n\n**Mermaid Diagram:**\n\n```mermaid\ngraph\
    \ TD;\n    A[Start] --> B[Connect to @codx-api];\n    B --> C[Initialize chat\
    \ functionalities];\n    C --> D{Receive user feedback};\n    D -->|Feedback received|\
    \ E[Modify code based on feedback];\n    D -->|No feedback| F[Search repository\

    \ J[Debug issues];\n    I --> K[Commit changes to version control];\n    J -->\
    \ K;\n    K --> L[End];\n```\n\nThis refined document outlines the development\
    \ process for the codx-agent, ensuring clarity and comprehensiveness. The mermaid\
    \ diagram illustrates the basic flow of the agent, from initial connection to\
    \ the @codx-api, through handling user feedback and repository searches, to testing\
    \ and documenting code changes."

- content: "Based on the provided context and user request, here's an updated version\
    \ of the task definition with corrections to the mermaid diagram and alignment\
    \ to the specified template:\n\n```md\n**Objective:**\n- Develop a codx-agent\
    \ in Python that integrates with the @codx-api to autonomously handle tasks related\
    \ to code development, testing, and user interaction.\n\n**Requirements:**\n-\
    \ The codx-agent must be capable of:\n  - Using the \"search\" function to gather\
    \ crucial information from the codebase.\n  - Splitting user requests into smaller,\
    \ manageable tasks for efficient processing.\n  - Implementing code changes autonomously\
    \ using gathered information.\n  - Executing tests to validate code changes and\
    \ iterating based on test outcomes.\n  - Maintaining version control for all code\
    \ modifications.\n  - Documenting all generated code and changes.\n  - Incorporating\
    \ debugging capabilities to ensure reliability and handle errors.\n\n**Examples:**\n\
    - Example 1: Utilize the \"search\" function to locate related code segments,\
    \ make necessary changes, and validate them through testing.\n- Example 2: Search\
    \ for existing implementations of a requested feature before attempting new code\
    \ additions.\n- Example 3: Execute a comprehensive test suite post-modification\
    \ to ensure integration and functionality.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ]\
    \ The codx-agent successfully integrates with the @codx-api and manages all tasks\
    \ autonomously.\n- [ ] The agent effectively uses the \"search\" function to gather\
    \ necessary information.\n- [ ] The agent can split requests into actionable tasks\
    \ and process them.\n- [ ] Code changes are implemented, tested, and iterated\
    \ until all tests pass, or an explanation is provided.\n- [ ] All code modifications\
    \ are version-controlled and documented.\n- [ ] Debugging features are implemented\
    \ and operational.\n- [ ] The agent provides a detailed process explanation after\
    \ task completion.\n- [ ] The agent exits the process with a detailed explanation\
    \ if tests continue to fail.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Consider implementing\
    \ a feedback loop for continuous improvement of the codx-agent.\n- Adhere to ethical\
    \ guidelines regarding autonomous code generation and user interaction.\n\n**Process\
    \ Flow Diagram:**\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Start Triggered by User] -->\
