To refine the document and add a basic coding agent flow with mermaid diagrams, we can start by structuring the task definition using the provided template. We'll also integrate mermaid diagrams to visually represent the agent's flow. Here's a refined version incorporating these elements:

```md
**Objective:**
- Develop a codx-agent in Python that integrates with the @codx-api to autonomously handle tasks related to code development, testing, and user interaction.

**Requirements:**
- The codx-agent must be able to:
  - Use chat functionalities to request and manage user feedback.
  - Search for existing code within the project repository efficiently.
  - Execute test files to ensure code integrity and functionality.
  - Write and modify code in the project, implementing requested changes autonomously.
  - Implement version control for any code changes made by the agent.
  - Provide documentation for all generated code and changes.
  - Include debugging capabilities to handle errors and ensure reliability.

**Examples:**
- Example 1: Use the chat tool to gather user feedback on a recent code change and integrate that feedback into the project.
- Example 2: Search the project repository for a specific function to determine if a similar implementation already exists.
- Example 3: Execute a test suite to validate recent changes and ensure no regressions have occurred.
- Example 4: Write a new module in Python for data processing based on provided specifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The codx-agent successfully integrates with the @codx-api and performs all assigned tasks autonomously.
- [ ] Chat functionality is implemented and allows for effective user feedback management.
- [ ] Search capabilities are efficient and accurate in finding existing code.
- [ ] The agent can execute and report on test files.
- [ ] Code writing and modification functionalities are reliable and meet project requirements.
- [ ] All code is version-controlled and documented.
- [ ] Debugging features are present and operational.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider implementing a feedback loop for continuous improvement of the codx-agent.
- Adhere to ethical guidelines regarding autonomous code generation and user interaction.

  - Incorporating debugging capabilities to ensure reliability and handle errors.

**Examples:**
- Example 1: Utilize the search function to locate related code segments, make necessary changes, and validate them through testing.
- Example 2: Search for existing implementations of a requested feature before attempting new code additions.
- Example 3: Execute a comprehensive test suite post-modification to ensure integration and functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The codx-agent successfully integrates with the @codx-api and manages all tasks autonomously.
- [ ] The agent effectively uses the search function to gather necessary information.
- [ ] The agent can split requests into actionable tasks and process them.
- [ ] Code changes are implemented, tested, and iterated until all tests pass, or an explanation is provided.
- [ ] All code modifications are version-controlled and documented.
- [ ] Debugging features are implemented and operational.
- [ ] The agent provides a detailed process explanation after task completion.
- [ ] The agent exits the process with a detailed explanation if tests continue to fail.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider implementing a feedback loop for continuous improvement of the codx-agent.
- Adhere to ethical guidelines regarding autonomous code generation and user interaction.

To refine the document according to the latest user request, we'll update the process flow to have only two exits: success or error after too many attempts. Additionally, we'll ensure the search results are used to improve task execution. The document will follow the specified template for clarity and consistency. Here's the revised version:

```md
**Objective:**
- Develop a codx-agent in Python that integrates with the @codx-api to autonomously handle tasks related to code development, testing, and user interaction.

**Requirements:**

  - Using the search function to gather crucial information from the codebase.
  - Splitting user requests into smaller, manageable tasks for efficient processing.
  - Implementing code changes autonomously using gathered information.
  - Executing tests to validate code changes and iterating based on test outcomes.
  - Maintaining version control for all code modifications.
  - Documenting all generated code and changes.
  - Incorporating debugging capabilities to ensure reliability and handle errors.

**Examples:**
- Example 1: Utilize the search function to locate related code segments, make necessary changes, and validate them through testing.
- Example 2: Search for existing implementations of a requested feature before attempting new code additions.

**Examples:**
- Example 1: Implement code changes based on user requests and validate them through testing.
- Example 2: Execute a comprehensive test suite post-modification to ensure integration and functionality.

- [ ] Debugging features are implemented and operational.
- [ ] The agent provides a detailed process explanation after task completion.
- [ ] The agent exits the process with a detailed explanation if tests continue to fail, or uses test output and user requests as new inputs if applicable.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider implementing a feedback loop for continuous improvement of the codx-agent.
- Adhere to ethical guidelines regarding autonomous code generation and user interaction.

**Process Flow Diagram:**

```mermaid

    A[Start Triggered by User] --> B[Split request into tasks];
    B --> E[Implement changes];
    E --> G[Run tests];
    G --> H{Test results};
    H -->|Pass| I[Document and finalize changes];
    H -->|Fail| J[Handle errors and retry];
    J --> K{Attempt count < 10?};
    K -->|Yes| G;
    K -->|No| L[Check if new flow input is available];
    L -->|Available| B;
    L -->|Not Available| M[Notify user and exit process];
    I --> N[Commit changes to version control];
    N --> O[Success: Process Complete];
```

This version includes a refined flow that checks for new input availability when tests fail and manages iterations based on the loop count. It adheres to the template and incorporates user feedback for improved clarity and functionality.
