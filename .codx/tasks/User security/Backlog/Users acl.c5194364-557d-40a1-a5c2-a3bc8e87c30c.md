**Objective:**
- Restrict access for cidx-junior users to project folders they are not assigned to.

**Requirements:**
- Implement an access control system that can differentiate user roles.
- Ensure only authorized users have access to specific project folders.
- Regular updates to user-role assignments and folder access lists.

**Examples:**
- A cidx-junior user should only access folders listed under their project assignments.
- If "Project A" is not assigned, the cidx-junior user should not see or access its folder.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The system correctly identifies user roles and project assignments.
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts by cidx-junior users are logged.
- [ ] cidx-junior users report access only to assigned project folders.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider notifying users if access is restricted due to role limitations.
- Evaluate potential integration with existing directory services for role management.
