    **Objective:**

    - Restrict access for cidx-junior users to project folders they are not assigned
    to.


    **Requirements:**

    - Implement an access control system that can differentiate user roles.

    - Ensure only authorized users have access to specific project folders.

    - Regular updates to user-role assignments and folder access lists.


    **Examples:**

    - A cidx-junior user should only access folders listed under their project assignments.

    - If "Project A" is not assigned, the cidx-junior user should not see or access
    its folder.


    **Acceptance Criteria:**

    - [ ] The system correctly identifies user roles and project assignments.

    - [ ] Unauthorized access attempts by cidx-junior users are logged.

    - [ ] cidx-junior users report access only to assigned project folders.


    **Additional Notes:**

    - Consider notifying users if access is restricted due to role limitations.

    - Evaluate potential integration with existing directory services for role management.
