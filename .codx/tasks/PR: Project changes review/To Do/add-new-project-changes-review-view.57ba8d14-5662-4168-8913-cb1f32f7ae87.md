# Project Changes View

## Overview

The "Project Changes" view is a new feature added to the project to facilitate the comparison between two branches or commits within a Git repository. This feature is crucial for developers and team members to understand the differences and changes made across different parts of the project.

## Features

1. **Branch/Commit Selection**:
   - Users can select any two branches or commits from the Git repository to compare.
   - A user-friendly interface will be available to facilitate easy selection and navigation.

2. **File Changes List**:
   - Once the branches or commits are selected, the view will display a list of all files that have changed between the two points.
   - Each file entry will include metadata such as file name, size, and type of change (e.g., modified, added, deleted).

3. **Diff View**:
   - The feature includes a comprehensive Diff view for each changed file.
   - Users can view line-by-line differences, with syntax highlighting and change indicators.
   - Options to collapse or expand diff sections for easy navigation and focus on relevant changes.

## User Interface

- The interface will be integrated into the existing project dashboard.
- A dedicated tab named "Project Changes" will be available for accessing this feature.
- Intuitive design elements will guide users in selecting branches/commits and navigating through changes.

## Use Cases

- **Code Review**: Quickly identify and review code differences before merging branches.
- **Version Tracking**: Understand project evolution by viewing changes between significant commits.
- **Bug Tracking**: Identify potential sources of bugs by examining recent changes to the codebase.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Issue Tracking**: Link changes directly to issues in the project management tool.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhance loading and processing speed for large repositories.
- **User Permissions**: Implement user permissions to restrict access to certain branches or sensitive information.

## Conclusion

The "Project Changes" view is an essential tool for improving collaboration and code quality within the development team. By providing a clear and detailed comparison of branches or commits, it enhances the ability to manage and integrate code effectively across the project.
