description: A new "Project Changes" view is being added to a project to facilitate
  the comparison of two branches or commits within a Git repository. This feature
  will allow users to select branches or commits, view a list of changed files, and
  see a detailed Diff view for each file. The interface will be integrated into the
  project dashboard and will serve use cases like code review, version tracking, and
  bug tracking. Future enhancements may include integration with issue tracking, performance
  optimizations, and user permissions. The feature aims to improve collaboration and
  code quality within the development team.

    ## Overview\n\nThe \"Project Changes\" view is a new feature added to the project\
    \ to facilitate the comparison between two branches or commits within a Git repository.\
    \ This feature is crucial for developers and team members to understand the differences\
    \ and changes made across different parts of the project.\n\n## Features\n\n1.\
    \ **Branch/Commit Selection**:\n   - Users can select any two branches or commits\
    \ from the Git repository to compare.\n   - A user-friendly interface will be\
    \ available to facilitate easy selection and navigation.\n\n2. **File Changes\
    \ List**:\n   - Once the branches or commits are selected, the view will display\
    \ a list of all files that have changed between the two points.\n   - Each file\
    \ entry will include metadata such as file name, size, and type of change (e.g.,\
    \ modified, added, deleted).\n\n3. **Diff View**:\n   - The feature includes a\
    \ comprehensive Diff view for each changed file.\n   - Users can view line-by-line\
    \ differences, with syntax highlighting and change indicators.\n   - Options to\
    \ collapse or expand diff sections for easy navigation and focus on relevant changes.\n\
    \n## User Interface\n\n- The interface will be integrated into the existing project\
    \ dashboard.\n- A dedicated tab named \"Project Changes\" will be available for\
    \ accessing this feature.\n- Intuitive design elements will guide users in selecting\
    \ branches/commits and navigating through changes.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **Code\
    \ Review**: Quickly identify and review code differences before merging branches.\n\
    - **Version Tracking**: Understand project evolution by viewing changes between\
    \ significant commits.\n- **Bug Tracking**: Identify potential sources of bugs\
    \ by examining recent changes to the codebase.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n-\
    \ **Integration with Issue Tracking**: Link changes directly to issues in the\
    \ project management tool.\n- **Performance Optimization**: Enhance loading and\
    \ processing speed for large repositories.\n- **User Permissions**: Implement\
    \ user permissions to restrict access to certain branches or sensitive information.\n\
    \n## Conclusion\n\nThe \"Project Changes\" view is an essential tool for improving\
    \ collaboration and code quality within the development team. By providing a clear\
    \ and detailed comparison of branches or commits, it enhances the ability to manage\
    \ and integrate code effectively across the project.\n```"
