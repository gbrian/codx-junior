To address the user's comment about ensuring that the `vncserver` and `firefox` processes are not running before starting them, we will make modifications in the script. We'll check for existing processes and only start them if they are not already running. I'll also demonstrate how a Git version control commit can be made for these changes.

The modified script with appropriate comments will look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Dynamically set CODX_JUNIOR_PATH to the parent directory of the script
export CODX_JUNIOR_PATH="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"
echo "CODX_JUNIOR_PATH: $CODX_JUNIOR_PATH"

# Source the environment variables
source ${CODX_JUNIOR_PATH}/.env

# Check if vncserver is already running, if not, start it
if ! pgrep -x "Xtightvnc" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Starting vncserver..."
    vncserver ${DISPLAY_NUM:-:1}
else
    echo "vncserver is already running."
fi

# Change directory to noVNC
cd ${CODX_JUNIOR_PATH}/noVNC

# Check if Firefox is already running, if not, start it
if ! pgrep -x "firefox" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Starting Firefox..."
    DISPLAY=${DISPLAY_NUM:-:1} firefox &
else
    echo "Firefox is already running."
fi

echo "Launch noVNC using websockify to bridge the VNC server to the web VNC client"
./utils/novnc_proxy --vnc localhost:${CODX_JUNIOR_NOVNC_PORT:-5901}
```

### Explanation:
- **pgrep** is used to check if a process is running. It searches for running processes and returns the process ID.
- If `vncserver` is not detected via `pgrep -x "Xtightvnc"`, the script starts it. Otherwise, it prints that `vncserver` is already running.
- Similarly, if the `firefox` process is not detected, it starts Firefox. Otherwise, it informs the user that Firefox is already running.

### Version Control with Git:
1. **Ensure Git is initialized**:   
    If not already done, initialize Git in the repository:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2. **Create a new branch** (following Git best practices to work in branches):

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix-process-checks
    ```

3. **Commit changes** after modifying the file:

    ```bash
    git add /shared/codx-junior/scripts/run_noVNC.sh
    git commit -m "Add checks to prevent running vncserver and firefox if they are already running"
    ```

4. **Push the branch to a remote repository** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    git push origin fix-process-checks
    ```

### Documentation:
- Update the project documentation or README file describing these changes.
- Ensure there is an explanation about how the script checks for already running processes.
- Maintain a change log, or add notes about this update for team members.

### Unit Testing:
Unit testing the script might require a separate setup to simulate process checking, generally not directly applicable to bash scripts. However, consider using a small module-specific script setup if the environment supports it (like integrating with a larger script testing framework/utils).
