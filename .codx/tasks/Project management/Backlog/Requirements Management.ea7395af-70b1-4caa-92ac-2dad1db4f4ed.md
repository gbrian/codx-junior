To effectively capture and document user requirements using codx-junior, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Centralized Document:**
   - Establish a single, organized document to serve as the repository for all brainstorming ideas and requirements. This will ensure easy access and reference for all team members.

2. **Capture Every Idea:**
   - During brainstorming sessions, document all ideas thoroughly. Avoid discarding any idea unless specifically instructed by the user to do so. This ensures that no potential solution or requirement is overlooked.

3. **Organize Thoughtfully:**
   - As you document ideas and requirements, categorize them under relevant headings and subheadings. This makes it easier for other team members to navigate and understand the information.

4. **Integrate Comments:**
   - Encourage team members to provide comments and feedback. Integrate these comments into the document in the appropriate sections, ensuring that all valuable insights are recorded and considered.

5. **Use Conceptual Language:**
   - Instead of mentioning specific brand names or products, use generic terms to describe tools and technologies. For example, refer to a "Task manager" instead of using a specific brand name like "Jira."

6. **Version Control:**
   - Implement a version control system to track changes and updates to the document. This helps maintain a history of the documentâ€™s evolution and ensures that previous versions can be referenced if needed.

7. **Regular Reviews:**
   - Schedule regular reviews to ensure that the documented requirements are current and align with stakeholder expectations. Use these sessions to make any necessary updates or adjustments.

8. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure that the document is easily accessible to all team members. Consider using cloud-based collaborative tools to allow real-time editing and access from different locations.

By following these guidelines, you will establish a robust system for capturing, organizing, and maintaining user requirements, enabling better collaboration and implementation within the project.
