To effectively capture and document user requirements using "codx-junior," while adhering to the guidelines you've provided, hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Create a Centralized Document**: 
   - Use a document management system where all user requirements and brainstorming ideas can be recorded.
   - Ensure the document is easy to navigate with a clear table of contents.

2. **Document Brainstorming Sessions**:
   - Record all ideas during brainstorming sessions in one section of the document titled "Brainstorming Ideas."
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists to ensure clarity.
   - Assign a note-taker during meetings to ensure no ideas are lost.

3. **Organize and Integrate Comments**:
   - Create sections within the document for each major feature or concept.
   - Place comments and related discussions under the relevant sections to maintain coherence.
   - Use headings and subheadings to organize content logically.

4. **Non-Brand Specific Terminology**:
   - Use conceptual terms rather than brand names throughout the document. Examples include using "Task Manager" instead of "Jira" or "Communication Tool" instead of "Slack."
   - Include a glossary of terms if necessary, to ensure all team members understand what each concept term refers to.

5. **Review and Update Regularly**:
   - Schedule regular reviews of the document to add new information and refine existing content.
   - Encourage team members to provide feedback and suggest edits as requirements evolve.
   - Keep a version history to track changes and ensure no information is accidentally lost.

6. **User Input and Feedback**:
   - Encourage users to review the documented requirements and provide feedback.
   - Integrate user comments in the appropriate sections, ensuring the document reflects current user needs and expectations.

By following this approach, "codx-junior" will capture and maintain user requirements effectively, ensuring they are accessible for team members and integrated into the project development process.
