- content: "To effectively capture and document user requirements using \"codx-junior,\"\
    \ while adhering to the guidelines you've provided, here\u2019s a structured approach:\n\
    \n1. **Create a Centralized Document**: \n   - Use a document management system\
    \ where all user requirements and brainstorming ideas can be recorded.\n   - Ensure\
    \ the document is easy to navigate with a clear table of contents.\n\n2. **Document\
    \ Brainstorming Sessions**:\n   - Record all ideas during brainstorming sessions\
    \ in one section of the document titled \"Brainstorming Ideas.\"\n   - Use bullet\
    \ points or numbered lists to ensure clarity.\n   - Assign a note-taker during\
    \ meetings to ensure no ideas are lost.\n\n3. **Organize and Integrate Comments**:\n\
    \   - Create sections within the document for each major feature or concept.\n\
    \   - Place comments and related discussions under the relevant sections to maintain\
    \ coherence.\n   - Use headings and subheadings to organize content logically.\n\
    \n4. **Non-Brand Specific Terminology**:\n   - Use conceptual terms rather than\
    \ brand names throughout the document. Examples include using \"Task Manager\"\
    \ instead of \"Jira\" or \"Communication Tool\" instead of \"Slack.\"\n   - Include\
    \ a glossary of terms if necessary, to ensure all team members understand what\
    \ each concept term refers to.\n\n5. **Review and Update Regularly**:\n   - Schedule\
    \ regular reviews of the document to add new information and refine existing content.\n\
    \   - Encourage team members to provide feedback and suggest edits as requirements\
    \ evolve.\n   - Keep a version history to track changes and ensure no information\
    \ is accidentally lost.\n\n6. **User Input and Feedback**:\n   - Encourage users\
    \ to review the documented requirements and provide feedback.\n   - Integrate\
    \ user comments in the appropriate sections, ensuring the document reflects current\
    \ user needs and expectations.\n\nBy following this approach, \"codx-junior\"\
    \ will capture and maintain user requirements effectively, ensuring they are accessible\
    \ for team members and integrated into the project development process."
