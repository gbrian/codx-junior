To create a cloud-init script for installing `codx-neko-rooms`, you'll want to automate the installation process by filling in the required variables (`IP`, `USER`, and `PASSWORD`) within the script. Here is a sample cloud-init script that you can use. This script assumes you have the necessary permissions and network access to execute the installer:

```yaml
#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true

runcmd:
  - curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbrian/codx-neko-rooms/main/installer.sh | IP=<your_ip> USER=<your_username> PASSWORD=<your_password> bash -s

# Replace <your_ip>, <your_username>, and <your_password> with your actual values.
```

### Steps to Use the Script

1. **Edit the Script**: Replace `<your_ip>`, `<your_username>`, and `<your_password>` with the actual values you wish to use for your `codx-neko-rooms` installation.

2. **Save the Script**: Save this script as a `.yaml` file, for example, `codx-neko-rooms-cloud-init.yaml`.

3. **Deploy**: Use this cloud-init script when launching your cloud instance. This can usually be done through your cloud provider's dashboard or CLI by specifying the file as user data.

### Additional Best Practices

- **Security**: Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords is securely handled. Consider using environment variables or secure storage solutions provided by your cloud provider.
  
- **Version Control**: Store your cloud-init scripts in a version-controlled repository, such as Git, to track changes and collaborate effectively.

- **Testing**: Test the script in a non-production environment to ensure it runs as expected.

- **Documentation**: Document the purpose and usage of the script in your project's documentation to help other team members understand its function.

By following these steps and best practices, you can ensure a smooth and secure installation of `codx-neko-rooms` using cloud-init.
