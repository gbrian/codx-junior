To create a task definition for running a local embedding model for knowledge, I'll follow the specified template. Here's a draft based on your input:

```md
### Run Local Embedding Model for Knowledge

**Objective:**
- Implement and run a local embedding model to process and store knowledge data effectively.

**Requirements:**
- Select an appropriate embedding model that can run locally.
- Ensure the model is compatible with the existing infrastructure.
- Prepare a dataset for embedding.
- Implement necessary preprocessing steps for the data.
- Ensure the environment has necessary dependencies and libraries installed.

**Examples:**
- Use models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT for generating embeddings.
- Preprocessing might include tokenization, removing stop words, etc.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] The embedding model is successfully installed and configured locally.
- [ ] The dataset is preprocessed and ready for embedding.
- [ ] The model runs without errors and generates embeddings.
- [ ] The output embeddings are stored in the designated format/location.
- [ ] Performance is validated against a sample query or benchmark.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider the size and complexity of the data when selecting the model.
- Document any modifications made to the model or data processing steps.
```

Feel free to provide more details or adjustments so the task definition can better suit your needs.
