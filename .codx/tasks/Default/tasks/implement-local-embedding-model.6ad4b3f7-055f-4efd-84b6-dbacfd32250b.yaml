    ### Run Local Embedding Model for Knowledge


    **Objective:**

    - Implement and run a local embedding model to process and store knowledge data
    effectively.


    **Requirements:**

    - Select an appropriate embedding model that can run locally.

    - Ensure the model is compatible with the existing infrastructure.

    - Prepare a dataset for embedding.

    - Implement necessary preprocessing steps for the data.

    - Ensure the environment has necessary dependencies and libraries installed.


    **Examples:**

    - Use models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT for generating embeddings.

    - Preprocessing might include tokenization, removing stop words, etc.


    **Acceptance Criteria:**

    - [ ] The embedding model is successfully installed and configured locally.

    - [ ] The dataset is preprocessed and ready for embedding.

    - [ ] The model runs without errors and generates embeddings.

    - [ ] The output embeddings are stored in the designated format/location.

    - [ ] Performance is validated against a sample query or benchmark.


    **Additional Notes:**

    - Consider the size and complexity of the data when selecting the model.

    - Document any modifications made to the model or data processing steps.
