Ok, this should go through socketio

To handle communication through Socket.IO in your project, you will need to define the events that your server will listen to and respond to, as well as any events that your clients will emit or listen to. Based on the files you have provided, it looks like you have a basic setup for a Socket.IO server using `socketio.AsyncServer`. Let's enhance this setup by adding some basic event handling.

Hereâ€™s how you can structure your server-side code to handle a basic set of Socket.IO events:

### Server-side Setup with Socket.IO

1. **Define Event Handlers:**

   You need to define handlers for the events you want to handle. These could be connection, disconnection, custom events, etc. Here's an example:

   ```python
   # /usr/local/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/sio/sio.py
   import logging
   import socketio

   # Initialize logger
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   # Create a Socket.IO server
   sio = socketio.AsyncServer(cors_allowed_origins='*', async_mode='asgi')

   # Define handlers for events
   @sio.event
   async def connect(sid, environ):
       logger.info(f"Client connected: {sid}")
       await sio.emit('message', {'message': 'Welcome!'}, room=sid)

   @sio.event
   async def disconnect(sid):
       logger.info(f"Client disconnected: {sid}")

   @sio.event
   async def message(sid, data):
       logger.info(f"Message from {sid}: {data}")
       await sio.emit('message', {'message': f"Received: {data}"}, room=sid)

   @sio.event
   async def error(sid, data):
       logger.error(f"Error from {sid}: {data}")

   # Create an ASGI application
   socket_app = socketio.ASGIApp(sio)
   ```

2. **Client-side Setup with Socket.IO Client:**

   On the client side, you'll use the `socket.io-client` library to connect to the server and handle events.

   ```js
   // /usr/local/codx-junior/client/src/api/socket.js
   import { io } from "socket.io-client";

   const socket = io("http://localhost:8000");  // Adjust the URL and port as needed

   socket.on("connect", () => {
     console.log(`Connected with id: ${socket.id}`);
   });

   socket.on("message", (data) => {
     console.log("Message from server:", data);
   });

   socket.on("disconnect", () => {
     console.log("Disconnected from server");
   });

   // Export the socket object for use in other parts of your application
   export default socket;
   ```

### Version Control and Testing

- **Version Control:** Ensure you are committing these changes to a Git repository. Use branches to manage different features or bug fixes.
  
- **Unit Testing:** Write tests for your event handlers to verify that they work as expected. You can use tools like `pytest` for testing Python code.

- **Documentation:** Update your project documentation to describe how the Socket.IO server is set up and how to use it from the client.

This setup provides a basic communication mechanism between a server and clients using Socket.IO. You can extend this by adding more events and logic as needed for your specific project requirements.
