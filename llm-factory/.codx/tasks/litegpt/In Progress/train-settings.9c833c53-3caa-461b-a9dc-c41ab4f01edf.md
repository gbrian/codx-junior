To speed up training on a CPU-only server with 64 vCPUs, consider the following settings and strategies:

1. **Batch Sizes**:
   - **Global Batch Size**: If memory allows, increase `global_batch_size` as larger batches often lead to better utilization of available CPUs.
   - **Micro Batch Size**: Increasing `micro_batch_size` can also be beneficial, but ensure it divides `global_batch_size` evenly.

2. **Parallelism**:
   - Take full advantage of data parallelism. Since you have 64 vCPUs, ensure that your data pipeline is optimized for parallel processing.

3. **Checkpointing and Logging**:
   - **Save Interval**: Increase `save_interval` to reduce the frequency of writing checkpoints, which can be I/O intensive.
   - **Log Interval**: While `log_interval` is already set to 1, logging too frequently can slow down training. Adjust this if you find it impacts performance.

4. **Learning Rate Warmup**:
   - Consider the strategy for `lr_warmup_steps`. Sometimes removing warmup (setting it to 0) can help, but this depends on your specific task and model.

5. **Maximum Steps and Tokens**:
   - If possible and depending on your dataset, consider setting concrete values for `max_tokens` or `max_steps` to ensure the training process efficiently utilizes compute resources without unnecessary prolongation.

6. **Sequence Length**:
   - **Max Seq Length**: If applicable, reduce `max_seq_length` to a manageable size that balances memory constraints and task requirements.

Here is how you might apply some of these changes in your configuration:

```python
# Increase global and micro batch sizes if there's memory headroom
global_batch_size: int = 128
micro_batch_size: int = 8

# Adjust save and log intervals for less I/O overhead
save_interval: Optional[int] = 5000
log_interval: int = 10

# If learning rate warmup is unnecessary, you could potentially set it to 0.
lr_warmup_steps: Optional[int] = 0

# Set appropriate maximum training limits based on dataset characteristics
# e.g., max_tokens or max_steps can be defined based on your resource availability
max_tokens: Optional[int] = 10_000_000  # Example value
```

Make sure to test these adjustments incrementally to ensure they don't negatively affect your model's performance or quality. Always validate that changes lead to actual runtime improvements without excessively compromising the model accuracy or convergence quality.

To adapt the command for a server with 64 vCPUs and 128GB of RAM, while considering your dataset size of 32K records, you can make a few adjustments for resource optimization. Given the ample CPU resources, you can increase the `--data.num_workers` for better data loading efficiency. You might also increase the batch sizes if memory allows. Here is how you could modify the command:

```bash
litgpt finetune microsoft/phi-2 \
  --data JSON \
  --data.num_workers 32 \  # Increase to utilize more CPU for data loading
  --data.json_path my_custom_dataset.json \
  --data.val_split_fraction 0.1 \
  --train.epochs 1 \
  --train.save_interval 5000 \  # Less frequent saving to reduce I/O
  --train.log_interval 10 \  # Less frequent logging
  --train.global_batch_size 128 \  # Increase batch size for better CPU utilization if memory permits
  --train.micro_batch_size 8 \  # Ensure it divides global batch size evenly, or adjust as necessary
  --train.lr_warmup_steps 0 \  # Consider removing warmup if not critical for finetuning
  --train.lr_warmup_fraction null \
  --train.max_tokens null \
  --train.max_steps null \
  --train.max_seq_length null \
  --train.tie_embeddings null \
  --train.max_norm null \
  --train.min_lr 6e-05 \
  --out_dir out/custom-model
```

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Data Workers**: Increased to 32 from 12 to better utilize the CPU resources during data loading.
2. **Save and Log Intervals**: Adjusted to reduce the frequency of operations that can introduce latency due to I/O and console updates.
3. **Batch Sizes**: Increased `global_batch_size` for improved CPU utilization. Ensure that your memory can handle this increase; adjust according to available memory after profiling.
4. **Learning Rate Warmup**: Removed steps by setting `lr_warmup_steps` to 0 if not needed for fine-tuning stability.

Before finalizing, it's a good practice to run these changes with profiling to ensure memory and CPU are efficiently utilized without bottlenecking other aspects of the training process. Adjust further based on these observations.

The error you're encountering appears to be related to a learning rate scheduler being defined with a lambda function that divides by `warmup_steps`, which is likely set to zero. This can cause a division by zero error. Let's address this issue by ensuring `warmup_steps` is set appropriately when using the scheduler. 

Here's how you might adjust this within your code to avoid the division by zero error:

### Check and Adjust the Code

Assuming the file where the error occurs is `lora.py`, locate and modify the scheduling logic:

```python /tmp/.venv_codx_junior_api/lib/python3.11/site-packages/litgpt/finetune/lora.py

# Ensure that warmup_steps is greater than 0 to avoid division by zero
warmup_steps = max(1, warmup_steps)  # Set a minimum value of 1

scheduler1 = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR(optimizer, lambda step: step / warmup_steps)
```

### Explanation:
- The change ensures that `warmup_steps` is never zero by using `max(1, warmup_steps)`. This avoids any division by zero in the lambda function used for the learning rate scheduler.
  
### Review Your Configuration:
- Ensure in your command or configuration that `lr_warmup_steps` is not set to zero unless you handle this internally in the code as shown above. If the training logic requires warmup to be explicitly zero for some configurations, ensure a proper check or alternative logic exists so that the learning rate scheduling does not trigger division by zero.

After making this change, try running your command again. This should help resolve the error related to the division by zero in the learning rate scheduler.
