description: codx-llm-factory is a service for fine-tuning Language Learning Models
  (LLMs) and providing search capabilities specifically for codx projects. It updates
  models based on changes in a project's base branch and uses RAG and indexed search
  for active branch changes. The service offers a REST API for triggering fine-tuning
  and interacting with fine-tuned models via an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint. It
  employs Python CPU-based techniques for fine-tuning, ensuring accessibility in various
  environments. The project welcomes contributions and is available under the MIT
  License.

- content: "# codx-llm-factory\n\ncodx-llm-factory is a specialized service designed\
    \ for fine-tuning Language Learning Models (LLMs) and providing search capabilities\
    \ for codx projects. This service ensures that codx projects are enhanced with\
    \ a continuously updated fine-tuned LLM model. It focuses on efficiency by only\
    \ updating models based on active changes in the project's base branch and performs\
    \ indexed searches to reflect current project activities.\n\n## Features\n\n-\
    \ **Fine-Tuning Service**: \n  - The service fine-tunes LLM models on a per-project\
    \ basis using the base branch of your codx projects. This ensures that the model\
    \ is continually updated to reflect recent changes and project requirements.\n\
    \n- **RAG and Indexed Search**:\n  - Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation\
    \ (RAG) and indexed search for active branch changes. Only files that are changed\
    \ in these active branches are indexed, providing a focused and relevant search\
    \ experience.\n\n- **REST API Interface**:\n  - A RESTful API is provided to interact\
    \ with the service, featuring endpoints for both model fine-tuning and chat capabilities\
    \ with the fine-tuned models.\n\n## API Endpoints\n\n### Fine Tuning\n- **Trigger\
    \ Fine-Tuning**:\n  - Endpoint: `/fine-tune`\n  - Method: `POST`\n  - Description:\
    \ Initiates the fine-tuning process for a specific project. This endpoint takes\
    \ the project ID or name as a parameter and triggers the creation of a fine-tuned\
    \ model based on the project's base branch.\n\n### Chat\n- **OpenAI-Compatible\
    \ Model Interaction**:\n  - Endpoint: `/chat`\n  - Method: `POST`\n  - Description:\
    \ Provides an OpenAI-compatible interface to chat with the fine-tuned models.\
    \ This endpoint facilitates conversations with the models, enabling query and\
    \ response interactions.\n\n## Technical Overview\n\n- **Performance**: The fine-tuning\
    \ process utilizes Python CPU-based techniques, optimizing for environments where\
    \ GPUs are unavailable or limited.\n  \n- **Dynamic Updates**: By focusing on\
    \ active branch changes, codx-llm-factory ensures the models remain relevant and\
    \ aligned with the latest codebase updates.\n\n- **Scalability**: The modular\
    \ design of the service allows for easy integration with other systems, while\
    \ the REST API provides a straightforward interaction method.\n\n## Getting Started\n\
    \n1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and set up the environment according\
    \ to the provided installation script.\n  \n2. **Configuration**: Adjust configuration\
    \ files to align with your specific project needs and API key requirements.\n\n\
    3. **Running the Service**: Start the service using the command-line interface.\
    \ The API should be accessible at the defined host and port.\n\n## Contributing\n\
    \nWe welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and reach of codx-llm-factory.\
    \ Please review our contribution guidelines in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.\n\n\

    \ the development team at [support@codx-llm-factory.com](mailto:support@codx-llm-factory.com).\n\
    \nBy using codx-llm-factory, codx projects can leverage advanced LLM capabilities\
    \ tailored to their specific needs, ensuring that their developments are supported\
    \ by cutting-edge AI enhancements."
