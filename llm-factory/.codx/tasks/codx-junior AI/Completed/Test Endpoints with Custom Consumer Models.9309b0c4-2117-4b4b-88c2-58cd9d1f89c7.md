### Objective
- Visual representation of testing processes using a sequence diagram.
- Clearly state the main goal: Test endpoints with consumer custom models for compatibility and functionality.

### Requirements
- Ensure endpoints can interact with custom consumer models.
- Validate compatibility and functionality of endpoints with different models.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Endpoints are tested with various consumer models.
- Compatibility and functionality are confirmed.

### Definition of done
Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked
 * [] Endpoints are tested with consumer models
 * [] Compatibility and functionality are verified

**Suggestion**: Develop automated tests using a framework like Postman or Pytest to ensure the endpoints work seamlessly with custom models.
