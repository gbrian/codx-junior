- content: "### Objective\n- Visual representation of testing processes using a sequence\
    \ diagram.\n- Clearly state the main goal: Test endpoints with consumer custom\
    \ models for compatibility and functionality.\n\n### Requirements\n- Ensure endpoints\
    \ can interact with custom consumer models.\n- Validate compatibility and functionality\
    \ of endpoints with different models.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Endpoints\
    \ are tested with various consumer models.\n- Compatibility and functionality\
    \ are confirmed.\n\n### Definition of done\nTask will be considered done once\
    \ all list entries are checked\n * [] Endpoints are tested with consumer models\n\
    \ * [] Compatibility and functionality are verified\n\n**Suggestion**: Develop\
    \ automated tests using a framework like Postman or Pytest to ensure the endpoints\
    \ work seamlessly with custom models."
