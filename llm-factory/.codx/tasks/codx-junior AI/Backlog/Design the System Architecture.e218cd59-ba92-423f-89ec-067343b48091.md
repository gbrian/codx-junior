### Objective
- Visual representation of the system architecture using a class diagram.
- Clearly state the main goal: Design the architecture for 'codx-junior LLM factory' to manage all LLM models.

### Requirements
- The architecture should include components for OpenAI-compatible endpoint exposure, model training, proxy for LLM providers, and API key management.
- Ensure scalability and flexibility to integrate with various LLM providers.

### Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive class diagram illustrating the system architecture.
- Identification of key components and their interactions.

### Definition of done
Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked
 * [X] Class diagram of the system architecture is created
 * [] Key components and interactions are clearly defined

**Suggestion**: Use tools like Lucidchart or draw.io to create the class diagram showcasing the architecture's components and their interactions.
