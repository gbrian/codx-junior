### Objective
- Visual representation of the training process using a sequence diagram.
- Clearly state the main goal: Develop an engine capable of training LLM models from codebases.

### Requirements
- Engine should support training from various codebases.
- Ensure compatibility with different LLM models.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Engine can successfully train LLM models using provided codebases.
- Integration tests confirm functionality across different models.

### Definition of done
Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked
 * [] Training engine is developed and operational
 * [] Tests confirm the engine's ability to train models from codebases

**Suggestion**: Use machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to build and test the training engine. Ensure compatibility with multiple LLM formats.
