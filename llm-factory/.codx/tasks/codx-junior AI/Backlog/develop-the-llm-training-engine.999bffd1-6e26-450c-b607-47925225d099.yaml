- content: "### Objective\n- Visual representation of the training process using a\
    \ sequence diagram.\n- Clearly state the main goal: Develop an engine capable\
    \ of training LLM models from codebases.\n\n### Requirements\n- Engine should\
    \ support training from various codebases.\n- Ensure compatibility with different\
    \ LLM models.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- Engine can successfully train LLM\
    \ models using provided codebases.\n- Integration tests confirm functionality\
    \ across different models.\n\n### Definition of done\nTask will be considered\
    \ done once all list entries are checked\n * [] Training engine is developed and\
    \ operational\n * [] Tests confirm the engine's ability to train models from codebases\n\
    \n**Suggestion**: Use machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch\
    \ to build and test the training engine. Ensure compatibility with multiple LLM\
    \ formats."
