### Objective
- Visual representation of the endpoint functionality using a sequence diagram.
- Clearly state the main goal: Implement OpenAI-compatible endpoints for chat, image, and embeddings.

### Requirements
- Endpoints must adhere to OpenAI standards.
- Include functionality for handling chat, image, and embedding requests.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Endpoints are operational and meet OpenAI compatibility standards.
- Successfully handle requests for chat, image, and embeddings.

### Definition of done
Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked
 * [X] Endpoints for chat, image, and embeddings are implemented
 * [] Endpoints are tested and verified to be OpenAI-compatible

**Suggestion**: Develop the endpoints using a framework like Flask or FastAPI and perform thorough testing against OpenAI's API specifications.
