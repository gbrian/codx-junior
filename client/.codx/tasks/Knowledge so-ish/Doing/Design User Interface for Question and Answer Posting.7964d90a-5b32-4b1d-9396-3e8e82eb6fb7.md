### Enhance Chat Functionality for Q&A

**Objective:**
- Develop a feature within the chat framework that enables users to post and organize questions and answers efficiently.

**Requirements:**
- Integrate the Q&A feature into the existing chat functionality.
- Design the interface to be user-friendly and intuitive.
- Ensure the design aligns with the current design language of the application.
- Utilize existing UI components to maintain consistency across the application.

**Examples:**
- A user should be able to post a question in the chat and receive answers that are threaded or linked directly to that question for easy navigation and organization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can successfully post questions and receive answers within the chat.
- The interface is intuitive, requiring minimal learning for users to navigate the Q&A feature.
- Visual consistency with the rest of the application is maintained.
- The feature is tested and confirmed to function without disrupting existing chat operations.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider the potential need for moderation tools to manage the quality and relevance of questions and answers.
- Explore the possibility of incorporating tagging or categorization for easy retrieval of past questions and answers.
