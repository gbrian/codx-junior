Show CodeEditor  at CodxJunior when selected tab is "editor"
## [[{"role": "assistant", "hide": false, "improvement": false, "created_at": "2024-10-20T13:01:47.272624", "images": [], "files": ["/src/views/CodxJunior.vue"]}]]
To show the `CodeEditor` at CodxJunior when the selected tab is "editor", ensure that the `tabIx` is set to `'editor'`. The component `EditorViewVue` is already configured to be displayed when `tabIx` is `'editor'` in your Vue file. Here’s the relevant code snippet from `/projects/codx-junior/client/src/views/CodxJunior.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Other components -->
  <div class="grow relative w-full">
    <div class="absolute top-0 left-0 right-0 bottom-0 overflow-auto">
      <EditorViewVue v-if="tabIx === 'editor'" />
      <!-- Other components -->
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

To activate this tab, ensure that your method for setting the active tab is called with `'editor'`:

```javascript
methods: {
  setActiveTab(tabIx) {
    console.log("Set active", tabIx);
    this.tabIx = tabIx;
    this.showBar = false;
  }
}
```

Make sure `setActiveTab('editor')` is called appropriately in your application logic to display the `CodeEditor`.

## [[{"role": "assistant", "hide": false, "improvement": false, "created_at": "2024-10-20T13:02:37.187083", "images": [], "files": ["/src/components/CodeEditor.vue", "/src/components/Code.vue"]}]]
To import the `CodeEditor` component in your Vue project, you should follow these steps based on the provided files:

1. **Import the CodeEditor Component**: Add an import statement for the `CodeEditor` component in the file where you want to use it. If you're importing it into a file like `CodxJunior.vue`, your import statement would look like this:

   ```javascript
   // /projects/codx-junior/client/src/views/CodxJunior.vue
   <script setup>
   import CodeEditor from '../components/Code.vue'; // Adjust the path as needed
   </script>
   ```

2. **Use the CodeEditor Component in Your Template**: Ensure that you include the `CodeEditor` component in your template, as shown in the `Code.vue` file.

   ```vue
   <!-- /projects/codx-junior/client/src/views/CodxJunior.vue -->
   <template>
     <div>
       <!-- Other components and logic -->
       <CodeEditor
         line-nums 
         :value="codeText"
         :languages="languages"
         font-size="0.75rem"
         width="100%"
         theme="github-dark"
         :header="false"
         v-if="tabIx === 'editor'"
       ></CodeEditor>
     </div>
   </template>
   ```

3. **Ensure Correct Library Import**: If the `CodeEditor` relies on a third-party library (as mentioned in `CodeEditor.vue`), make sure that the library is correctly imported and configured as needed.

   ```javascript
   // /projects/codx-junior/client/src/components/CodeEditor.vue
   <script setup>
   import { ref } from 'vue';
   import { CodeEditor as CodeEditorLibrary } from 'simple-code-editor'; // Ensure this is correct
   </script>
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to import and use the `CodeEditor` component in your Vue project. Adjust the paths as necessary to fit your project's structure.
