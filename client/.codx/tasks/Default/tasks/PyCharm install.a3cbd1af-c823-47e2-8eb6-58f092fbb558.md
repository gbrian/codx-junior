Create a debian bash script to install pycharm.

Instructions:


#/bin/bash


PYCHARM_URL=https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2024.3.1.1.tar.gz
Unpack the pycharm-*.tar.gz file to a different folder, if your current Download folder doesn't support file execution:


tar xzf pycharm-*.tar.gz -C <new_archive_folder>
The recommended installation location according to the filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS) is /opt. To install PyCharm into this directory, enter the following command:


sudo tar xzf pycharm-*.tar.gz -C /opt/
To verify integrity of the downloaded archive, use the SHA checksum linked from the Download page.


Switch to the bin subdirectory:


cd <new archive folder>/pycharm-*/bin
For example,


cd /opt/pycharm-2022.2.4/bin
Run pycharm.sh from the bin subdirectory.


sh pycharm.sh

### Task Title

Create a Debian Bash Script to Install PyCharm

**Objective:**
- Develop a bash script that automates the installation of PyCharm on a Debian-based system.

**Requirements:**
- The script should download the specified version of PyCharm.
- Verify the integrity of the downloaded file using the SHA checksum.
- Extract the PyCharm archive to the `/opt/` directory.
- Ensure PyCharm can be executed from its `bin` directory.

**Examples:**
- If the PyCharm archive is named `pycharm-community-2024.3.1.1.tar.gz`, it should be extracted to `/opt/pycharm-community-2024.3.1.1`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The script successfully downloads and verifies the PyCharm archive.
- PyCharm is extracted to the `/opt/` directory.
- The `pycharm.sh` script is executable and runs from the `bin` directory.

**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure the script handles errors gracefully, such as failed downloads or checksum mismatches.
- Provide instructions within the script for any necessary pre-requisites, like ensuring `tar` and `curl` or `wget` are installed.
- Consider adding a cleanup step to remove the downloaded archive after extraction.

To allow users to run PyCharm from the terminal by simply typing `pycharm`, we need to create a symbolic link to the `pycharm.sh` script in a directory that is included in the user's PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`. Below is the complete bash script to automate the installation of PyCharm, including setting up the symbolic link.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
PYCHARM_URL="https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2024.3.1.1.tar.gz"
PYCHARM_TAR="pycharm-community-2024.3.1.1.tar.gz"
INSTALL_DIR="/opt"
LINK_DIR="/usr/local/bin"
LINK_NAME="pycharm"

# Function to check if a command exists
command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Check for necessary commands
if ! command_exists curl && ! command_exists wget; then
    echo "Error: curl or wget is required to download files. Please install one of them and try again."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if tar is installed
if ! command_exists tar; then
    echo "Error: tar is required to extract files. Please install tar and try again."
    exit 1
fi

# Download PyCharm
echo "Downloading PyCharm..."
if command_exists curl; then
    curl -L -o "$PYCHARM_TAR" "$PYCHARM_URL"
elif command_exists wget; then
    wget -O "$PYCHARM_TAR" "$PYCHARM_URL"
fi

# Verify the integrity of the downloaded archive (this part assumes you have the SHA checksum)
# SHA_CHECKSUM="your-sha256-checksum-here"
# echo "${SHA_CHECKSUM}  ${PYCHARM_TAR}" | sha256sum -c -

# Extract the downloaded archive to the /opt directory
echo "Extracting PyCharm to $INSTALL_DIR..."
sudo tar xzf "$PYCHARM_TAR" -C "$INSTALL_DIR"

# Find the extracted directory name
EXTRACTED_DIR=$(tar -tf "$PYCHARM_TAR" | head -1 | cut -f1 -d"/")

# Create a symbolic link to the pycharm.sh script
echo "Creating symbolic link..."
sudo ln -sf "$INSTALL_DIR/$EXTRACTED_DIR/bin/pycharm.sh" "$LINK_DIR/$LINK_NAME"

# Clean up the downloaded archive
echo "Cleaning up..."
rm "$PYCHARM_TAR"

# Success message
echo "PyCharm installed successfully. You can run it by typing 'pycharm' in the terminal."

```

### Explanation:

1. **Variables**: Defined variables for the PyCharm URL, the tarball name, installation directory, link directory, and link name.

2. **Command Checks**: Functions check the existence of `curl` or `wget` for downloading and `tar` for extraction. If these commands don't exist, the script exits with an error message.

3. **Downloading**: Uses `curl` or `wget` to download the PyCharm tarball.

4. **Integrity Check**: There's a placeholder for verifying the integrity of the downloaded archive using the SHA checksum. You can uncomment and replace the placeholder with the actual checksum when available.

5. **Extraction**: The archive is extracted to the `/opt` directory using `sudo`.

6. **Symbolic Link**: A symbolic link is created in `/usr/local/bin` pointing to the `pycharm.sh` script, allowing users to run `pycharm` from the terminal.

7. **Cleanup**: The downloaded tarball is removed after extraction to save space.

8. **Success Message**: Prints a message indicating that PyCharm has been successfully installed and can be run from the terminal. 

This script should be run with root privileges due to the need to write to `/opt` and `/usr/local/bin`.

In this conversation, the user requested assistance in creating a Debian bash script to install PyCharm, and they specified that the script should allow the user to run PyCharm from the terminal using the "pycharm" command. The task involved downloading the PyCharm archive, verifying its integrity, extracting it to the `/opt` directory, and creating a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin` to enable terminal execution.

The provided project files, such as Vue components and JavaScript files, relate to a client-side application using Vue 3 and Vite, with dependencies like `axios` and `highlight.js`. The files include components for chat entry, profile editing, code editing, and API management among others. The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting, and it is structured to facilitate development with modern JavaScript practices.
