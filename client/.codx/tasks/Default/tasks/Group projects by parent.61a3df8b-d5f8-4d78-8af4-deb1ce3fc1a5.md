We must show projects nested in project dropdown selector. To group projects use project_path, create a projectHerarchy getter in project store that will next projects checking if the project_path is a child path of another project_path

To achieve this nested dropdown selector for projects using a `projectHierarchy` getter, we can assume you're working with a front-end framework like Vue.js, where Vuex or Pinia stores might be used. The idea is to create a hierarchical structure based on the `project_path`.

Here's a general approach to how you might implement this:

1. **Organize Projects by Path**: First, organize the projects in a way that allows you to easily determine parent-child relationships based on their `project_path`.

2. **Create the projectHierarchy Getter**: Implement a getter that constructs a hierarchical structure.

Here's a sample implementation:

```javascript
// Assuming we're using Vuex or a similar state management library
const state = {
  projects: [
    // Example project data
    { id: 1, name: 'Project A', project_path: 'project_a' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Project B', project_path: 'project_a/project_b' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Project C', project_path: 'project_a/project_c' },
    { id: 4, name: 'Project D', project_path: 'project_d' }
  ]
};

const getters = {
  projectHierarchy: (state) => {
    const hierarchy = {};

    state.projects.forEach(project => {
      const pathParts = project.project_path.split('/');
      let currentLevel = hierarchy;

      pathParts.forEach((part, index) => {
        if (!currentLevel[part]) {
          currentLevel[part] = {
            project: index === pathParts.length - 1 ? project : null,
            children: {}
          };
        }
        currentLevel = currentLevel[part].children;
      });
    });

    return hierarchy;
  }
};

// Usage example
const projectHierarchy = getters.projectHierarchy(state);
console.log(projectHierarchy);
```

### Explanation

- **State**: We have a list of projects, each with a `project_path`.
  
- **Getter (projectHierarchy)**: 
  - We iterate over each project and split its `project_path` into parts.
  - We build a nested structure (`hierarchy`) by iterating over these parts, creating a nested object structure.
  - If a part of the path doesn't exist in the current level, we initialize it.
  - If the current part is the last part of the path, we associate the project with it.

### Additional Steps

- **Render the Dropdown**: Use this hierarchical structure to render your dropdown in a way that reflects the hierarchy, using a recursive component or function to display children within parents.

- **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure to handle cases where project paths might be incorrectly formatted or duplicate.

This approach will help you create a nested dropdown selector that reflects the project hierarchy based on the `project_path`.
