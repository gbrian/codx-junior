### Task Title

Display Navigation Bar Icons on Mobile

**Objective:**
- Ensure that the navigation bar icons are visible and accessible on mobile devices.

**Requirements:**
- The navigation bar must be responsive and adapt to different mobile screen sizes.
- Icons should be clearly visible and easily tappable on mobile devices.
- Maintain consistency with the design and iconography used in the desktop version.

**Examples:**
- Ensure icons such as 'Home', 'Search', 'Profile', and 'Settings' are displayed in a horizontal row at the bottom of the mobile screen.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Navigation bar icons should be visible without any overlap or cut-off issues on screens as small as 320px in width.
- Users should be able to tap on each icon without difficulty.
- The design should be aligned with the overall theme and style of the app.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider incorporating a hamburger menu if there are too many icons to fit comfortably on the screen.
- Test the navigation bar on different mobile devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
