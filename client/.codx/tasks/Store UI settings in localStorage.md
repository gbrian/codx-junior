At store ui instead of using "this.commit" use $storex.ui to call save_state and load_state. Rename "load_state" by "loadState" and "save_state" by saveState.

## Role Overview

As an Agile software analyst, your primary role is to facilitate the conversion of business requirements into well-defined user stories for the development team. Your expertise ensures that each user story is concise, actionable, and directly aligned with business objectives.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Requirement Analysis**: 
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to gather and understand business requirements in detail.

2. **User Story Creation**: 
   - Break down complex requirements into manageable user stories that are easily understood by developers.

3. **Business Language**: 
   - Maintain business-centric language when defining tasks to ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations.

4. **Clear Instructions**: 
   - Provide clear and actionable instructions within each user story to minimize ambiguity.

5. **Acceptance Criteria**: 
   - Define precise acceptance criteria for each user story to ensure successful implementation and validation.

6. **Clarification**: 
   - Identify and document any areas requiring further clarification, facilitating ongoing communication between stakeholders and developers.

## Agile Task Example

### Task: Display Latest Published Events

#### Description
We need to show the last published events in the user's notification dialog.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- When the user clicks on the notification icon, the popup should display the latest events.
- Ensure the events are sorted by the most recent first.

#### Clarification
Q: Should the events displayed be limited to those published within a specific timeframe, such as the last 3 days?

### User Stories

#### User Story 1: Add New Method to Retrieve Events
- Introduce a new method in the database handler module to fetch the latest published events. This method should accept a parameter indicating the number of days to consider for recent events.

#### User Story 2: Update User Interface for Notifications
- Enhance the user's notification popup module to display the list of recent events. The popup should show the event title and date for each event.

## DOUBTS
- Are there any additional business rules or constraints associated with the events to be displayed?
- Is there a need for localization or customization based on user preferences in the notification popup?

Based on the user's request and the context provided in the project files, I'll create a new task to update the Vuex store module for UI state management. Here's how the task should be structured:

### Task: Update UI State Management Method Calls

#### Description
Modify the Vuex store module for UI state management to replace the use of `this.commit` with `$storex.ui` for method calls. Additionally, rename the methods `load_state` to `loadState` and `save_state` to `saveState`.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Replace `this.commit('save_state')` with `$storex.ui.saveState()` in the `mutations`.
- Replace `commit('load_state')` with `$storex.ui.loadState()` in the `actions`.
- Update method names from `load_state` to `loadState` and `save_state` to `saveState` in the Vuex store module.
- Ensure that the UI state is still correctly persisted and loaded from `localStorage`.

#### Clarifications
- Confirm that the `$storex.ui` accessor is correctly set up to call the `saveState` and `loadState` methods.
- Ensure all instances of the renamed methods are updated consistently throughout the codebase.

### Updated Code Example

Here's an updated example of the relevant parts of the `ui.js` store module:

```javascript
import { getterTree, mutationTree, actionTree } from 'typed-vuex'
import { $storex } from '.'

export const namespaced = true

export const state = () => ({
  showCoder: false,
  showPreview: false
})

export const mutations = mutationTree(state, {
  toggleCoder(state) {
    state.showCoder = !state.showCoder
    if (state.showCoder && state.showPreview) {
      state.showPreview = false
    }
    $storex.ui.saveState()
  },
  togglePreview(state) {
    state.showPreview = !state.showPreview
    if (state.showCoder && state.showPreview) {
      state.showCoder = false
    }
    $storex.ui.saveState()
  },
  saveState(state) {
    localStorage.setItem('uiState', JSON.stringify(state))
  }
})

export const getters = getterTree(state, {
  splitView: () => $storex.ui.showCoder || $storex.ui.showPreview
})

export const actions = actionTree(
  { state, getters, mutations },
  {
    async init ({ state, commit }) {
      $storex.ui.loadState()
    },
    loadState({ state }) {
      const savedState = localStorage.getItem('uiState')
      if (savedState) {
        const parsedState = JSON.parse(savedState)
        state.showCoder = parsedState.showCoder
        state.showPreview = parsedState.showPreview
      }
    }
  },
)
```

This task ensures that the Vuex module adheres to the naming conventions and modular state management approach outlined by the user's request. Make sure to test the changes to confirm that the UI state behaves as expected.

## [[{"role": "assistant", "hide": false, "improvement": false, "created_at": "2024-10-14T06:35:33.561303", "images": [], "files": ["/src/App.vue"]}]]
To address the user's request, we need to update the Vuex store by adding a mutation to handle the preview URL, and then modify the `App.vue` file to use this new mutation. Here's how you can go about it:

1. **Update Vuex Store**: Add a mutation called `setPreviewUrl` in the Vuex store to manage the preview URL state.

2. **Modify `App.vue`**: 
   - Use `$storex.ui` to call `saveState` and `loadState` instead of `this.commit`.
   - Replace `preViewUrl` with a Vuex state property and use `setPreviewUrl` to update it.

### Step 1: Update Vuex Store

Assuming your Vuex store configuration is in a file like `store/modules/ui.js`, add the following mutation:

```javascript
// store/modules/ui.js
const state = {
  previewUrl: "_blank_",
  // other state properties
};

const mutations = {
  setPreviewUrl(state, url) {
    state.previewUrl = url;
  },
  // other mutations
};

export default {
  state,
  mutations,
  // other configurations like actions, getters
};
```

### Step 2: Modify `App.vue`

Update the `App.vue` component to use the new Vuex mutation and state.

```javascript
<template>
  <!-- existing template code -->
  <div class="h-full relative grow flex flex-col p-1" v-if="$storex.ui.showPreview">
    <label class="grow input input-sm input-bordered flex items-center gap-2">
      <input type="text" class="grow" :value="previewUrl" placeholder="Enter url..." @keydown.enter="updatePreviewUrl($event.target.value)" />
      <i class="fa-solid fa-magnifier"></i>
    </label>  
    <iframe ref="iframe" :src="previewUrl" class="h-full w-full border-0 bg-base-300"
      title="preview"
      allow="camera *;microphone *;clipboard-read; clipboard-write;"
      :key="iframeKey"
      @load="onPreviewLoaded"
      >
    </iframe>
  </div>
  <!-- existing template code -->
</template>

<script>
export default {
  // existing setup
  computed: {
    previewUrl() {
      return this.$storex.ui.previewUrl;
    },
    // other computed properties
  },
  methods: {
    updatePreviewUrl(url) {
      this.$store.commit('setPreviewUrl', url);
    },
    onPreviewLoaded() {
      this.$store.commit('setPreviewUrl', this.previewUrl);
    },
    // other methods
  }
};
</script>
```

### Explanation

- **Vuex Store**: We added a `setPreviewUrl` mutation to update the `previewUrl` state.
- **App.vue**: 
  - The `previewUrl` is now a computed property that fetches its value from the Vuex store.
  - The `updatePreviewUrl` method updates the Vuex state when the user enters a new URL.
  - The `onPreviewLoaded` method is triggered once the iframe has loaded, confirming the URL has been set.

This setup ensures that the preview URL is managed centrally through Vuex, making it accessible across different components in your application.
