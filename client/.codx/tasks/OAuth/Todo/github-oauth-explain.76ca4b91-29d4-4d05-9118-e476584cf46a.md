Authorizing OAuth apps
You can enable other users to authorize your OAuth app.




In this article
Note




Consider building a GitHub App instead of an OAuth app.




Both OAuth apps and GitHub Apps use OAuth 2.0.




GitHub Apps can act on behalf of a user, similar to an OAuth app, or as themselves, which is beneficial for automations that do not require user input. Additionally, GitHub Apps use fine-grained permissions, give the user more control over which repositories the app can access, and use short-lived tokens. For more information, see Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth apps and About creating GitHub Apps.




GitHub's OAuth implementation supports the standard authorization code grant type and the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant for apps that don't have access to a web browser.




If you want to skip authorizing your app in the standard way, such as when testing your app, you can use the non-web application flow.




To authorize your OAuth app, consider which authorization flow best fits your app.




web application flow: Used to authorize users for standard OAuth apps that run in the browser. (The implicit grant type is not supported.)
device flow: Used for headless apps, such as CLI tools.
Web application flow
Note




If you are building a GitHub App, you can still use the OAuth web application flow, but the setup has some important differences. See Authenticating with a GitHub App on behalf of a user for more information.




The web application flow to authorize users for your app is:




Users are redirected to request their GitHub identity
Users are redirected back to your site by GitHub
Your app accesses the API with the user's access token
1. Request a user's GitHub identity
GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
This endpoint takes the following input parameters.




Query parameter	Type	Required?	Description
client_id	string	Required	The client ID you received from GitHub when you registered.
redirect_uri	string	Strongly recommended	The URL in your application where users will be sent after authorization. See details below about redirect urls.
login	string	Optional	Suggests a specific account to use for signing in and authorizing the app.
scope	string	Context dependent	A space-delimited list of scopes. If not provided, scope defaults to an empty list for users that have not authorized any scopes for the application. For users who have authorized scopes for the application, the user won't be shown the OAuth authorization page with the list of scopes. Instead, this step of the flow will automatically complete with the set of scopes the user has authorized for the application. For example, if a user has already performed the web flow twice and has authorized one token with user scope and another token with repo scope, a third web flow that does not provide a scope will receive a token with user and repo scope.
state	string	Strongly recommended	An unguessable random string. It is used to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks.
code_challenge	string	Strongly recommended	Used to secure the authentication flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). Required if code_challenge_method is included. Must be a 43 character SHA-256 hash of a random string generated by the client. See the PKCE RFC for more details about this security extension.
code_challenge_method	string	Strongly recommended	Used to secure the authentication flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). Required if code_challenge is included. Must be S256 - the plain code challenge method is not supported.
allow_signup	string	Optional	Whether or not unauthenticated users will be offered an option to sign up for GitHub during the OAuth flow. The default is true. Use false when a policy prohibits signups.
prompt	string	Optional	Forces the account picker to appear if set to select_account. The account picker will also appear if the application has a non-HTTP redirect URI or if the user has multiple accounts signed in.
CORS pre-flight requests (OPTIONS) are not supported at this time.




2. Users are redirected back to your site by GitHub
If the user accepts your request, GitHub redirects back to your site with a temporary code in a code parameter as well as the state you provided in the previous step in a state parameter. The temporary code will expire after 10 minutes. If the states don't match, then a third party created the request, and you should abort the process.




Exchange this code for an access token:




POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
This endpoint takes the following input parameters.




Parameter name	Type	Required?	Description
client_id	string	Required	The client ID you received from GitHub for your OAuth app.
client_secret	string	Required	The client secret you received from GitHub for your OAuth app.
code	string	Required	The code you received as a response to Step 1.
redirect_uri	string	Strongly recommended	The URL in your application where users are sent after authorization. We can use this to match against the URI originally provided when the code was issued, to prevent attacks against your service.
code_verifier	string	Strongly recommended	Used to secure the authentication flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). Required if code_challenge was sent during the user authorization. Must be the original value used to generate the code_challenge in the authorization request. This can be stored in a cookie alongside the state parameter or in a session variable during authentication, depending on your application architecture.
By default, the response takes the following form:




access_token=gho_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a&scope=repo%2Cgist&token_type=bearer
You can also receive the response in different formats if you provide the format in the Accept header. For example, Accept: application/json or Accept: application/xml:




Accept: application/json
{
  "access_token":"gho_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a",
  "scope":"repo,gist",
  "token_type":"bearer"
}
Accept: application/xml
<OAuth>
  <token_type>bearer</token_type>
  <scope>repo,gist</scope>
  <access_token>gho_16C7e42F292c6912E7710c838347Ae178B4a</access_token>
</OAuth>
3. Use the access token to access the API
The access token allows you to make requests to the API on a behalf of a user.




Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN
GET https://api.github.com/user
For example, in curl you can set the Authorization header like this:




curl -H "Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
Every time you receive an access token, you should use the token to revalidate the user's identity. A user can change which account they are signed into when you send them to authorize your app, and you risk mixing user data if you do not validate the user's identity after every sign in.

To create an authentication flow for a web application using GitHub's OAuth, follow these steps, taking care to implement best practices for security and usability:

1. **Set Up Your OAuth App on GitHub:**
   - Register your application on GitHub to obtain your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
   - Specify a `redirect_uri` on your application settings where users will be redirected after authorization.

2. **Implement the Authentication Flow:**

   You can break it down into several steps in your web application codebase. Here's an outline of each step in a web application using a hypothetical setup:

### Step 1: Request a User's GitHub Identity

- Direct users to GitHub's authorization URL. You might have an endpoint in your application to handle this redirection:

```js /routes/auth.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Replace these with your OAuth app's details
const clientID = 'your_client_id';
const redirectURI = 'your_redirect_uri';
const state = 'random_string_for_csrf_protection';

router.get('/login', (req, res) => {
  const authorizeUrl = `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=${clientID}&redirect_uri=${redirectURI}&state=${state}`;
  res.redirect(authorizeUrl);
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Step 2: Handle Redirect from GitHub

- GitHub will redirect back to your specified `redirect_uri` with a temporary code. You should have an endpoint to receive this code and then exchange it for an access token:

```js /routes/auth.js
const axios = require('axios');

router.get('/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code, state: returnedState } = req.query;

  // Verify state for security
  if (returnedState !== state) {
    return res.status(403).send('State mismatch. Request forbidden.');
  }

  try {
    const tokenResponse = await axios.post('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token', {
      client_id: clientID,
      client_secret: 'your_client_secret',
      code,
      redirect_uri: redirectURI
    }, {
      headers: { Accept: 'application/json' }
    });

    const { access_token } = tokenResponse.data;
    // Proceed to use the token
    res.redirect(`/welcome?access_token=${access_token}`);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error exchanging code for token.');
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Step 3: Use the Access Token

- Use this token to access GitHub's API on behalf of the user:

```js /routes/user.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const axios = require('axios');

router.get('/welcome', async (req, res) => {
  const token = req.query.access_token;

  try {
    const userResponse = await axios.get('https://api.github.com/user', {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
    });

    res.status(200).json({ user: userResponse.data });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching user information.');
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Security Considerations:

- **State parameter**: Use a strong, unpredictable state to protect against CSRF attacks.
- **PKCE**: Implement Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for additional security, especially in public clients.
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all traffic, particularly redirect URIs, is handled over HTTPS.
- **Storage**: Securely store tokens and ensure you handle user data in compliance with any relevant privacy regulations.
