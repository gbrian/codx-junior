Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.\n\n## Scalability\nDesign for horizontal scaling by adding more instances of servers.\n\n## Caching\nUse caching to improve performance and reduce server load.\n\n## Error Handling\nImplement comprehensive error handling and logging.\n\n## API Versioning\nUse versioning in APIs to manage changes without breaking clients.\n\n## Data Validation\nValidate data on both client and server sides.\n\n## Asynchronous Processing\nUse asynchronous calls to improve client responsiveness.\n\n## Load Balancing\nUse load balancers to distribute incoming traffic evenly across servers.\n", "path": "/shared/codx-junior/.codx/profiles/project.json"}
