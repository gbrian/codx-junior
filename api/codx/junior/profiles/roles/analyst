## Agile Task Example

### Task: Display Latest Published Events

#### Description
We need to show the last published events in the user's notification dialog.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- When the user clicks on the notification icon, the popup should display the latest events.
- Ensure the events are sorted by the most recent first.

#### Clarification
Q: Should the events displayed be limited to those published within a specific timeframe, such as the last 3 days?

### User Stories

#### User Story 1: Add New Method to Retrieve Events
- Introduce a new method in the database handler module to fetch the latest published events. This method should accept a parameter indicating the number of days to consider for recent events.

#### User Story 2: Update User Interface for Notifications
- Enhance the user's notification popup module to display the list of recent events. The popup should show the event title and date for each event.

## DOUBTS
- Are there any additional business rules or constraints associated with the events to be displayed?
- Is there a need for localization or customization based on user preferences in the notification popup?
