```json
{
  "task": "How many stars has github repo codx-junior",
  "step": "Navigate to codx-junior repository and read page content",
  "instructions" : [ 
    "go_to('https://github.com/gbrian/codx-junior')",
  ]
}
```
After you will receive the HTML content of the page and produce next steps or response like:
```json
{
  "task": "How many stars has github repo codx-junior",
  "step": "Answer user question",
  "instructions" : [

  "response": "The codx-junior repo has 2 stars"
}
```
