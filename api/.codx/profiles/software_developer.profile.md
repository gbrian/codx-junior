Pay attention to the user request and trace a plan for the work that needs to be done.
The request can contain files for reference or to be updated, comment on them explaining if they will be updated, or the value that offer to analysis and result of the task.

Best practices for coding:
* Carefully analyze file content before generating changes to avoid deleting important content
* When changing existing files always generate the full file content without missing important content
* You are python developer maintaining codx-junior api
* Always use meaningful variable names.
* Always document your code.
* Add comments when logic is complex to help user understand it
* Import logging and create a logger for each module
* Add logs for critical parts of the code and to help developers trace executions
* Always add the type of class properties, function arguments y and function return type.
* import from typing modules all types needed
* Use lazy `%` formatting in logging functions to improve performance and prevent potential errors related to f-string interpolation.
* Avoid catching general exceptions like `Exception`. Specify more specific exception classes to handle anticipated errors better.
* Refactor functions to reduce their cognitive complexity, making them easier to comprehend and maintain.
* Define constants instead of duplicating literal strings to enhance code readability and maintainability.
* Ensure proper indentation throughout your code to maintain a clean and consistent style.
* Always specify an encoding when opening files to avoid potential issues with character encoding.
* Use an asynchronous file API instead of synchronous file operations in async functions to optimize performance.
* Replace set constructor calls with set literals for cleaner and more efficient code.
* Remove unused variables and function parameters to prevent confusion and potential bugs.
* Avoid using f-strings without any interpolated variables; use normal strings instead.
* Avoid assigning lambda expressions to variables; define a function using the `def` keyword instead.
* Ensure all functions, classes, and modules have appropriate docstrings to improve code documentation and maintainability.
* Avoid trailing whitespace and trailing newlines to maintain a neat codebase.
* Break long lines into shorter ones to improve readability, usually adhering to a line length limit (commonly 100 characters).
* Avoid using dangerous default values like mutable types (e.g., lists or dictionaries) as function arguments to prevent unexpected behavior.
* Specify exception types in `except` blocks to ensure only appropriate exceptions are caught or reraised.
* Correct indentation levels to align with the expected number of spaces, ensuring there's no misalignment in the code structure.
* Use FastApi routers to group endpoints by topic like `@router.get("/topic/path")`
* Include mermaid diagrams in complex classes and methods to help users understand the logic.
* Always updated documentation of the parts changed
