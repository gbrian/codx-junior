description: In this conversation, the user seeks guidance on creating a subtask within
  a FastAPI project called `codx-api`. The project consists of `app` and `engine`
  modules, which handle API endpoints and core functionalities, respectively. The
  proposed approach involves identifying the main task, implementing core subtask
  logic in the appropriate module, integrating with existing components, testing thoroughly,
  and maintaining documentation. An example demonstrates adding a subtask for project
  analysis by defining logic in the `engine` module and setting up a new endpoint
  in the `app` module. This ensures a modular and maintainable architecture.

- content: "To create a subtask within your project, you should define the task in\
    \ a way that fits into your existing project structure and workflow. Here's a\
    \ general approach to creating a subtask in a FastAPI project like the `codx-api`,\
    \ considering the descriptions of your modules. You may adjust these steps according\
    \ to your specific project requirements:\n\n### Steps to Create a Subtask:\n\n\
    1. **Identify the Main Task:**\n   - Determine the main task or functionality\
    \ to which this subtask belongs. This will help in structuring the functionality\
    \ and deciding its place in your application.\n\n2. **Define the Subtask Logic:**\n\
    \   - Implement the core logic for your subtask in the appropriate module. Given\
    \ the descriptions of your modules:\n     - If your subtask is related to core\
    \ functionalities (like project creation, session management), you would add its\
    \ logic to the `engine` module.\n     - If it involves setting up new API endpoints,\
    \ you may need to modify the `app` module.\n\n3. **Modify the `engine` Module:**\n\
    \   - Add a new function or class in the `engine` module that encapsulates the\
    \ logic for your subtask.\n   - Ensure it interacts appropriately with existing\
    \ functions and adheres to the overall structure and architecture of your project.\n\
    \n4. **Integrate with the `app` Module:**\n   - If your subtask involves a new\
    \ API endpoint:\n     - Define a new endpoint in the `app` module using FastAPI.\n\
    \     - Make sure to import the logic from the `engine` module and use it within\
    \ your endpoint function.\n   - If real-time updates are necessary, ensure that\
    \ it integrates well with the existing Socket.IO setup.\n\n5. **Update Background\
    \ Tasks (if needed):**\n   - If your subtask requires any asynchronous processing,\
    \ ensure it is properly setup as a background task in the `app` module.\n\n6.\
    \ **Test the Subtask:**\n   - Write unit tests or integration tests to ensure\
    \ your subtask works correctly and integrates well with the rest of the system.\n\
    \   - Use FastAPI\u2019s testing utilities to simulate API requests if it's an\
    \ endpoint-related task.\n\n7. **Documentation and Cleanup:**\n   - Document your\
    \ subtask both in code (comments, docstrings) and in any project documentation\
    \ you maintain.\n   - Review your code for cleanliness, ensuring it adheres to\
    \ the project's style guides and conventions.\n\n### Example Implementation:\n\
    \nAssuming you are adding a subtask to handle a new type of project analysis:\n\
    \n**In the `engine` module:**\n```python\ndef perform_analysis(project_id: int):\n\
    \    # Core logic for the analysis subtask\n    # Interact with the database or\
    \ other components as needed\n    pass\n```\n\n**In the `app` module:**\n```python\n\
    from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException\n\nrouter = APIRouter()\n\n@router.post(\"\
    /projects/{project_id}/analyze\")\nasync def analyze_project(project_id: int):\n\
    \    try:\n        # Call the method from the engine module\n        result =\
    \ engine.perform_analysis(project_id)\n        return {\"success\": True, \"data\"\
    : result}\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=500,\
    \ detail=str(e))\n```\n\nThis approach keeps your architecture modular and helps\
    \ in maintaining and extending the project efficiently."
