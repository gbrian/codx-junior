To create a subtask within your project, you should define the task in a way that fits into your existing project structure and workflow. Here's a general approach to creating a subtask in a FastAPI project like the `codx-api`, considering the descriptions of your modules. You may adjust these steps according to your specific project requirements:

### Steps to Create a Subtask:

1. **Identify the Main Task:**
   - Determine the main task or functionality to which this subtask belongs. This will help in structuring the functionality and deciding its place in your application.

2. **Define the Subtask Logic:**
   - Implement the core logic for your subtask in the appropriate module. Given the descriptions of your modules:
     - If your subtask is related to core functionalities (like project creation, session management), you would add its logic to the `engine` module.
     - If it involves setting up new API endpoints, you may need to modify the `app` module.

3. **Modify the `engine` Module:**
   - Add a new function or class in the `engine` module that encapsulates the logic for your subtask.
   - Ensure it interacts appropriately with existing functions and adheres to the overall structure and architecture of your project.

4. **Integrate with the `app` Module:**
   - If your subtask involves a new API endpoint:
     - Define a new endpoint in the `app` module using FastAPI.
     - Make sure to import the logic from the `engine` module and use it within your endpoint function.
   - If real-time updates are necessary, ensure that it integrates well with the existing Socket.IO setup.

5. **Update Background Tasks (if needed):**
   - If your subtask requires any asynchronous processing, ensure it is properly setup as a background task in the `app` module.

6. **Test the Subtask:**
   - Write unit tests or integration tests to ensure your subtask works correctly and integrates well with the rest of the system.
   - Use FastAPIâ€™s testing utilities to simulate API requests if it's an endpoint-related task.

7. **Documentation and Cleanup:**
   - Document your subtask both in code (comments, docstrings) and in any project documentation you maintain.
   - Review your code for cleanliness, ensuring it adheres to the project's style guides and conventions.

### Example Implementation:

Assuming you are adding a subtask to handle a new type of project analysis:

**In the `engine` module:**
```python
def perform_analysis(project_id: int):
    # Core logic for the analysis subtask
    # Interact with the database or other components as needed
    pass
```

**In the `app` module:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/projects/{project_id}/analyze")
async def analyze_project(project_id: int):
    try:
        # Call the method from the engine module
        result = engine.perform_analysis(project_id)
        return {"success": True, "data": result}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

This approach keeps your architecture modular and helps in maintaining and extending the project efficiently.
