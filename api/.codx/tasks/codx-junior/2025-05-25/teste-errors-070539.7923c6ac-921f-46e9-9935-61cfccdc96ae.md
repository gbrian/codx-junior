Key areas to investigate include endpoint functionality, middleware, and Socket.IO integration. Testing should cover asynchronous tasks, session management logic in the engine module, and error handling. Recommendations include reviewing logs, ensuring comprehensive test coverage, and using a debugger for complex issues. Keeping API documentation up to date and checking for dependency conflicts is also advised to resolve errors efficiently.", "created_at": "2025-05-25 17:04:52.920512", "updated_at": "2025-05-25T17:06:11.074340", "mode": "chat", "kanban_id": "", "column_id": "", "board": "codx-junior", "column": "2025-05-25", "chat_index": 0, "url": "", "branch": "", "file_path": "/home/codx-junior/codx-junior/api/.codx/tasks/codx-junior/2025-05-25/teste-errors-070539.7923c6ac-921f-46e9-9935-61cfccdc96ae.md", "model": "", "visibility": ""}]]
