description: The discussion centers around addressing test errors in the `codx-api`,
  a Python FastAPI backend for `codx-junior`. Key areas to investigate include endpoint
  functionality, middleware, and Socket.IO integration. Testing should cover asynchronous
  tasks, session management logic in the engine module, and error handling. Recommendations
  include reviewing logs, ensuring comprehensive test coverage, and using a debugger
  for complex issues. Keeping API documentation up to date and checking for dependency
  conflicts is also advised to resolve errors efficiently.
