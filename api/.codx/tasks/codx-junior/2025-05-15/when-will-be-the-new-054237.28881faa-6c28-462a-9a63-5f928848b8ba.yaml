    \ is a Python FastAPI backend exposing all functionalities for codx-junior.\n\n\
    ### App Module\nThe `app` module initializes the FastAPI application and defines\
    \ its configuration, routes, and middleware. It sets up various API endpoints\
    \ to handle requests related to chats, projects, files, and more. Additionally,\
    \ it manages background tasks and integrates with Socket.IO for real-time communication.\n\
    \n### Engine Module\nThe `engine` module handles core functionalities such as\
    \ project creation, session management, and other high-level operations crucial\
    \ for the application's objectives. It provides the necessary backend logic to\
    \ support the features exposed by the app module.\n\n### New Design for Dashboard\n\
    \nThe new design for the dashboard is currently in development. The timeline for\
    \ the completion of the new design is as follows:\n\n- **Current Status:** In\
    \ Progress\n- **Expected Completion Date:** 2023-10-15\n\n### Key Features of\
    \ the New Dashboard Design\n1. **Enhanced User Interface:**\n   - Improved visual\
    \ appeal with modern UI components.\n   - Streamlined layout for better user experience.\n\
    \n2. **Real-Time Updates:**\n   - Utilizes Socket.IO for real-time data updates.\n\
    \   - Ensures that users see the most current information without needing to refresh\
    \ the page.\n\n3. **Task Management:**\n   - Enhanced task management system with\
    \ detailed task templates.\n   - Users can easily create, update, and track tasks\
    \ using the provided template.\n\n4. **Project and File Management:**\n   - Improved\
    \ project and file management features.\n   - Users can now manage projects and\
    \ files more efficiently.\n\n5. **Performance Optimization:**\n   - Optimized\
    \ for better performance and responsiveness.\n   - Reduced load times and improved\
    \ overall system stability.\n\n### Example of Task Template\nHere is an example\
    \ of the task template used in the new dashboard design:\n\n```md\n### Objective\n\
    - Visual representation of the task in a mermaid diagram: class, sequence, mind\
    \ map, Entity Relation,...\n- Clearly state the main goal of the task.\n\n###\
    \ User Requirements\n- List all necessary requirements or conditions.\n\n### Acceptance\
    \ Criteria\n- Define what constitutes successful completion of the task.\n\n###\
    \ Definition of done\nTask will be consider done once all list entries are checked\n\
    \ * [X] Example of task done \n * [] Example of pending task \n```\n\n### Contact\
