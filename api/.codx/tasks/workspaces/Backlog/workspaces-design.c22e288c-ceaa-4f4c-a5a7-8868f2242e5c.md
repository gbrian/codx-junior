Workspaces will allow admins to create workspaces and associate with projects.
Admins will be able to choose among multiples docker images like codx-junior:workspace-webtop.
A workspace has:
 * id: A uuid
 * name
 * description
 * image
 * projects: List of projects


For each workspace we'll run a container mapped with all selected project paths.
To serve workaspaces we'll have a traefik service with docker enabled and we'll access workspace by "name" like /workspace-id

To implement this functionality, you'll need to define a system that manages workspaces, including their creation, association with projects, and deployment using Docker containers. Here's a rough outline of the necessary components and their implementation:

1. **Workspace Management**: This involves creating, updating, and deleting workspaces, along with associating them with projects.

2. **Docker Integration**: Use Docker to run containers for each workspace. This will include setting up Docker images and mapping project paths.

3. **Traefik Configuration**: Traefik will act as a reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate workspace container based on the workspace ID.

Here's a basic implementation outline in code:

### 1. Workspace Model

```python /models/workspace.py
import uuid

class Workspace:
    def __init__(self, name, description, image, projects):
        self.id = uuid.uuid4()
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.image = image
        self.projects = projects
```

### 2. Docker Management

For Docker management, you can use the Docker SDK for Python to create and manage containers.

```python /services/docker_service.py
import docker

class DockerService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = docker.from_env()

    def create_container(self, workspace):
        container = self.client.containers.run(
            image=workspace.image,
            name=f"workspace-{workspace.id}",
            volumes=self._map_projects(workspace.projects),
            detach=True
        )
        return container

    def _map_projects(self, projects):
        # Assuming projects is a list of project paths
        return {project: {'bind': project, 'mode': 'rw'} for project in projects}
```

### 3. Traefik Configuration

Traefik configuration will involve setting up dynamic routing based on workspace IDs. This typically involves setting labels on Docker containers.

```yaml /traefik/traefik.toml
[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.web]
    address = ":80"

[providers.docker]
  endpoint = "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
  exposedByDefault = false

[http.routers]
  [http.routers.workspace]
    rule = "PathPrefix(`/workspace-{id}`)"
    service = "workspace-service"

[http.services]
  [http.services.workspace-service]
    loadBalancer.server.port = 80
```

### 4. Admin Interface

Create an interface for admins to manage workspaces. This could be a simple web interface using a framework like Flask or Django.

```python /app/admin_interface.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from models.workspace import Workspace
from services.docker_service import DockerService

app = Flask(__name__)
docker_service = DockerService()

@app.route('/workspaces', methods=['POST'])
def create_workspace():
    data = request.json
    workspace = Workspace(
        name=data['name'],
        description=data['description'],
        image=data['image'],
        projects=data['projects']
    )
    container = docker_service.create_container(workspace)
    return jsonify({"workspace_id": str(workspace.id), "container_id": container.id}), 201
```

### Notes

- Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your host machine.
- Traefik should be properly configured and running as a Docker container.
- This is a basic setup. In a production environment, consider adding authentication, error handling, logging, and more robust configuration management.
- This code is a starting point and may need to be adapted to fit the specific requirements and infrastructure of your environment.
