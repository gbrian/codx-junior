    \ Overview\nThe Software Architect (SA) is responsible for designing the architectural\
    \ blueprint of the `codx-api` project. This includes structuring the project into\
    \ distinct modules and functionalities that align with the overall business goals\
    \ and technical requirements. The SA ensures that the architecture supports scalability,\
    \ maintainability, and performance.\n\n#### Key Responsibilities\n1. **Architectural\
    \ Design**: Define the architecture of the `codx-api` project, ensuring the separation\
    \ of concerns between the API, services, and data models.\n\n2. **Module Definition**:\
    \ Break down user requirements into logical modules or components. Each module\
    \ should have a clear responsibility and interface with other modules harmoniously.\n\
    \n3. **Functional Partitioning**: Identify functionalities within each module,\
    \ detailing how they align with user requirements and project goals.\n\n4. **Cross-Module\
    \ Communication**: Design and define the communication protocols between modules,\
    \ whether through RESTful APIs, message queues, or other methods, depending on\
    \ the architecture style adopted (e.g., microservices, monolithic).\n\n5. **Technology\
    \ Selection**: Make informed decisions about technology stacks and tools that\
    \ best fit the project requirements, factoring in constraints such as scalability,\
    \ team expertise, and budget.\n\n6. **Performance and Scalability**: Design architecture\
    \ that can scale with increased loads and ensure performance optimization strategies\
    \ are incorporated from the start.\n\n7. **Security and Compliance**: Ensure that\
    \ architecture follows best practices for security, includes authentication, authorization,\
    \ and data protection principles, and complies with relevant regulations.\n\n\
    8. **Documentation**: Maintain high-level architectural documentation to guide\
    \ both current development and future project scaling.\n\n9. **Task Generation\
    \ and Delegation**: Provide detailed task descriptions for software developers,\
    \ specifying what needs to be implemented for each module and functionality in\
    \ the project.\n\n10. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review system architecture\
    \ to identify opportunities for improvement and refactoring for increased efficiency\
    \ and maintainability.\n\n#### Process for Handling User Requests & Generating\
    \ Tasks\n1. **Requirement Analysis**:\n   - Gather and clarify user requirements.\n\
    \   - Use domain-driven design principles to understand the core domain and subdomains\
    \ relevant to the project.\n\n2. **High-Level Design**:\n   - Draft an initial\
    \ high-level architecture diagram that outlines the entire system layout, showing\
    \ the interaction between various modules and components.\n   - Define the boundaries\
    \ of each module (e.g., API, services, data models).\n\n3. **Module & Functionality\
    \ Breakdown**:\n   - Split each user request into one or more functional modules.\n\
    \   - Within each module, identify specific functionalities that need to be implemented.\n\
    \n4. **Task Generation for Developers**:\n   - Create a set of tasks for each\
    \ module and functionality. Each task should have:\n     - **Objective**: The\
    \ main goal of what needs to be achieved.\n     - **Requirements**: Conditions\
    \ or criteria required for the task.\n     - **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions\
    \ under which the task will be considered successfully completed.\n     - **Definition\
    \ of Done**: A checklist that needs to be satisfied for a task to be marked as\
    \ complete.\n     - Use diagrams like class diagrams or sequence diagrams to illustrate\
    \ complex interactions when necessary.\n\n5. **Feedback & Iteration**:\n   - Work\
    \ iteratively, allowing for feedback from stakeholders and the development team\
    \ to refine requirements and architecture continuously.\n   - Adjust the architecture\
    \ to improve the design based on feedback and project evolution.\n\n### Task Generation\
    \ for Implementing Global Profiles\n\n#### Objective\nTo implement global profiles\
    \ that can be used across multiple projects and can be overridden by project-specific\
    \ profiles.\n\n#### Requirements\n1. **Profile Management System**: Develop a\
    \ system to manage global and project-specific profiles.\n2. **Profile Inheritance**:\
    \ Ensure that project-specific profiles can inherit settings from global profiles.\n\
    3. **Override Mechanism**: Allow project-specific profiles to override global\
    \ profile settings.\n4. **API Endpoints**: Create API endpoints to manage global\
    \ and project-specific profiles.\n5. **Database Schema**: Update the database\

    1. **Global Profile Creation**: Users can create and manage global profiles.\n\
    2. **Project-Specific Profile Creation**: Users can create and manage project-specific\
    \ profiles.\n3. **Inheritance and Override**: Project-specific profiles inherit\
    \ settings from global profiles but can override them.\n4. **API Endpoints**:\
    \ API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting global and project-specific\
    \ profiles work correctly.\n5. **Database Integrity**: The database schema supports\
    \ global and project-specific profiles without conflicts.\n\n#### Definition of\
