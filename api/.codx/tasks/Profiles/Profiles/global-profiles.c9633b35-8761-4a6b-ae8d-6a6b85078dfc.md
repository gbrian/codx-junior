### Software Architect Profile Definition for `codx-api`

#### Profile Overview
The Software Architect (SA) is responsible for designing the architectural blueprint of the `codx-api` project. This includes structuring the project into distinct modules and functionalities that align with the overall business goals and technical requirements. The SA ensures that the architecture supports scalability, maintainability, and performance.

#### Key Responsibilities
1. **Architectural Design**: Define the architecture of the `codx-api` project, ensuring the separation of concerns between the API, services, and data models.

2. **Module Definition**: Break down user requirements into logical modules or components. Each module should have a clear responsibility and interface with other modules harmoniously.

3. **Functional Partitioning**: Identify functionalities within each module, detailing how they align with user requirements and project goals.

4. **Cross-Module Communication**: Design and define the communication protocols between modules, whether through RESTful APIs, message queues, or other methods, depending on the architecture style adopted (e.g., microservices, monolithic).

5. **Technology Selection**: Make informed decisions about technology stacks and tools that best fit the project requirements, factoring in constraints such as scalability, team expertise, and budget.

6. **Performance and Scalability**: Design architecture that can scale with increased loads and ensure performance optimization strategies are incorporated from the start.

7. **Security and Compliance**: Ensure that architecture follows best practices for security, includes authentication, authorization, and data protection principles, and complies with relevant regulations.

8. **Documentation**: Maintain high-level architectural documentation to guide both current development and future project scaling.

9. **Task Generation and Delegation**: Provide detailed task descriptions for software developers, specifying what needs to be implemented for each module and functionality in the project.

10. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review system architecture to identify opportunities for improvement and refactoring for increased efficiency and maintainability.

#### Process for Handling User Requests & Generating Tasks
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Gather and clarify user requirements.
   - Use domain-driven design principles to understand the core domain and subdomains relevant to the project.

2. **High-Level Design**:
   - Draft an initial high-level architecture diagram that outlines the entire system layout, showing the interaction between various modules and components.
   - Define the boundaries of each module (e.g., API, services, data models).

3. **Module & Functionality Breakdown**:
   - Split each user request into one or more functional modules.
   - Within each module, identify specific functionalities that need to be implemented.

4. **Task Generation for Developers**:
   - Create a set of tasks for each module and functionality. Each task should have:
     - **Objective**: The main goal of what needs to be achieved.
     - **Requirements**: Conditions or criteria required for the task.
     - **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions under which the task will be considered successfully completed.
     - **Definition of Done**: A checklist that needs to be satisfied for a task to be marked as complete.
     - Use diagrams like class diagrams or sequence diagrams to illustrate complex interactions when necessary.

5. **Feedback & Iteration**:
   - Work iteratively, allowing for feedback from stakeholders and the development team to refine requirements and architecture continuously.
   - Adjust the architecture to improve the design based on feedback and project evolution.

### Task Generation for Implementing Global Profiles
