                    Here's a summary of our conversation along with the provided context:

### Summary

We have discussed reorganizing the `CODXJuniorSession` class from the `engine.py` file into more specialized classes. This involves identifying logical groups of methods and functions and assigning them to classes that better adhere to the single responsibility principle. By doing so, you can enhance the maintainability and readability of the code structure.

### Keywords

- Method Extraction
- Code Reorganization
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Maintainability
- Code Readability

### Instructions Summary

- When making file changes and creating code blocks, you should:
  - Include the full file name in the starting line of the code block, using the format: ` ```<language> <filename>`
  - Avoid trimming file names to preserve full paths for clarity.

### Execution Plan

1. **ProjectManager Class**:
   - Responsible for managing project switching, deletion, and related project methods, such as checking project changes or getting project branches.

2. **KnowledgeManager Class**:
   - Handles knowledge retrieval, search queries, deletion, and updating processes.

3. **ChatService Class**:
   - Focuses on managing chat operations, including loading, saving, and interacting with chats.

4. **FileManager Class**:
   - Manages file operations, such as reading/writing files, applying patches, and listing directories.

5. **ProfileManager Class**:
   - Responsible for handling user profiles, including loading, saving, and deleting profiles.

6. **KnowledgeUpdater Class**:
   - Deals with updating knowledge from external sources or by analyzing code changes.

7. **UtilityServices Class**:
   - Contains utility functions for logging, handling AI services, and more.

### Next Steps

- Refactor the current `CODXJuniorSession` class by moving methods to newly designated classes following the proposed plan.
- Ensure all changes align with the existing architecture and follow the basic style guide instructions provided in your setup.
- Verify functionality after restructuring to ensure no disruptions in existing workflows.

The refactoring should enhance the code's modularity and provide a clearer structure, which can be particularly beneficial for debugging and future enhancements.

<task>
Introduce a new class named `KnowledgeManager` to manage all operations related to knowledge handling. Follow these steps to ensure a smooth integration:

1. **Create the `KnowledgeManager` Class:**
   - Define a new class `KnowledgeManager` in its own module file to encapsulate all knowledge-related operations.
   
2. **Extract Methods from `CODXJuniorSession`:**
   - Identify and move the following methods related to knowledge from `CODXJuniorSession` to the new `KnowledgeManager`:
     - `get_knowledge`
     - `reload_knowledge`
     - `knowledge_search`
     - `delete_knowledge_source`
     - `delete_knowledge`
     - `select_afefcted_documents_from_knowledge`
     - `check_knowledge_status`
     - `extract_query_mentions`
     - `find_projects_by_mentions`
     - `extract_tags`
     - `get_keywords`

3. **Ensure Code Consistency:**
   - Check all method dependencies and ensure that any required state or configuration is accessible within `KnowledgeManager`. This may involve passing the necessary parameters or utilizing dependency injection.
   - Update any remaining references in `CODXJuniorSession` and other parts of the codebase to use the newly separated `KnowledgeManager`.

4. **Maintain Functionality:**
   - Validate that no functionality is lost during the extraction process. Ensure that the `KnowledgeManager` integrates seamlessly with the current code and performs all intended operations correctly.
   - Perform thorough testing on all methods to confirm that they operate as expected in isolation and within the overall system.

5. **Documentation and Style Guide:**
   - Document the `KnowledgeManager` class and its methods thoroughly, adhering to any existing documentation standards.
   - Follow the code style guidelines for consistency throughout the implementation.

6. **Review and Testing:**
   - Conduct a peer review of the new class to gather feedback and make improvements.
   - Implement unit tests for each method in `KnowledgeManager` to validate their behavior and maintain robustness.

The proposed changes aim to streamline the codebase, making it more modular, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.
