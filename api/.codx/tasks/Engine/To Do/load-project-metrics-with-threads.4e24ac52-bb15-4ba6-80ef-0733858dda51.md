## Using Threads to Load Project Metrics in `api_find_all_projects`

In the `api_find_all_projects` function, we're tasked with improving performance by utilizing threading to load project metrics. The current implementation sequentially loads metrics for each project, which can be time-consuming. Instead, we can expedite this process by using threads to handle multiple metrics loading concurrently.

### Approach

We'll use Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize the task of loading metrics across projects. This will involve:

1. Importing the `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module.
2. Creating a function to fetch project metrics that can be executed in threads.
3. Modifying the `api_find_all_projects` function to execute metric loading in a thread pool.

### Implementation

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of how to implement this:

#### Step 1: Import Necessary Module

At the top of your file, add:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
```

#### Step 2: Create a Function to Fetch Metrics

Define a function to fetch metrics for a project using given settings:

```python
def fetch_project_metrics(project):
    try:
        settings = CODXJuniorSettings(**project)
        project["_metrics"] = CODXJuniorSession(settings=settings).get_project_metrics()
    except Exception as ex:
        logger.exception("Error adding metrics to project: %s", ex)
        project["_error"] = str(ex)
    return project
```

#### Step 3: Modify `api_find_all_projects` to Use ThreadPoolExecutor

Update the function as follows:

```python
@app.get("/api/projects")
def api_find_all_projects(request: Request, user: CodxUser = Depends(get_authenticated_user)):
    with_metrics = request.query_params.get("with_metrics") == "1"
    all_projects = list(find_all_user_projects(user))
    
    if with_metrics:
        with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            all_projects = list(executor.map(fetch_project_metrics, all_projects))
    
    return all_projects
```

### Conclusion

By employing `ThreadPoolExecutor`, we enable concurrent processing of project metrics, which significantly improves the response time of the `api_find_all_projects` endpoint. This approach efficiently utilizes the processor, leading to a smoother and faster API experience.
