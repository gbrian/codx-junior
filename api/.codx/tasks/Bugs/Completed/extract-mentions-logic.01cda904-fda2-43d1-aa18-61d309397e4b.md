We must extract from the method check_file_for_mentions the part that manages reading and writing the file.
We'll have  check_file_for_mentions that will receive a file and extract mentions, 
then call to new method process_file_mentions passing metions and all needed to generate the new content using the call_back


Adapt check_file_for_mentions to work with the new method: process_file_mentions

process_file_mentions will receive the initial content, a list of mentions and a call_back to use
