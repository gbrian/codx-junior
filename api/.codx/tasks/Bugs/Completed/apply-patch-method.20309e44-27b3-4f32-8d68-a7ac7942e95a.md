Implement apply_patch method
It will receive a diff string with information of the file and changes to apply.
Extract the file to change from the diff
Append a <codx></codx> section to the end with the diff file with this instructions:
Apply this patch:
```diff
{ patch }
```


Save file.

To implement the `apply_patch` method, we'll extract the filename from the diff and append a `<codx></codx>` section with the given diff at the end of the file. When the file is modified, we'll make sure to update it with the appropriately formatted instruction block.

Here's how you can implement it:

```python
async def apply_patch(self, patch: str):
    # Extract the file path from the diff
    file_diff_lines = patch.split('\n')
    file_path = None

    for line in file_diff_lines:
        if line.startswith('+++ b/'):
            file_path = line[6:]  # Removes '+++ b/' to get the file path
            break

    if not file_path:
        logger.error("No file path found in patch.")
        return
    
    # Determine the full path.
    if not file_path.startswith(self.settings.project_path):
        file_path = os.path.join(self.settings.project_path, file_path)

    # Read the existing content of the file if it exists
    existing_content = ""
    if os.path.exists(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
            existing_content = f.read()

    # Prepare the new content by appending the patch in the required format
    new_content = existing_content + f"""

<codx>
Apply this patch:
```diff {file_path}
{patch}
```
</codx>
"""

    # Create directories if they do not exist
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path), exist_ok=True)

    # Save the updated content back to the file
    with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
        f.write(new_content)

    logger.info(f"Patch applied and saved to {file_path}")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extract the File Path:** We first parse the patch to find filenames, which typically start with `+++ b/` in a unified diff format.
2. **Existing File Content:** Check if the file exists and read its current contents.
3. **Update the File:** Append a new section with the provided patch, incorporating it using a `<codx></codx>` block.
4. **Save Changes:** Write updated content back to the file, making sure the directory structure exists.
