We want to create a knowledge agent that will receive a conversation and a request and will search on the project's knowledge for references.


Agent will make searches until been confident with the response.


Agent will ask user for input in case of ambiguity or not having a confident answer after 3 searches.

### Plan and File Analysis
1. **Create a New Agent (`KnowledgeAgent`)**:
   - Initialize with agent name and session.
   - Implement functionality to perform multiple searches based on a conversation and request.
   - Handle the scenario where searches are inconclusive by asking the user for input.

2. **Methods Implementation**:
   - `search_knowledge_base`: Determines the confident response from searches or resorts to user input if uncertain.
   - `_perform_search`: Simulates a search process in the knowledge database.
   - `_is_confident_response`: Logic placeholder for evaluating response confidence based on search results.
   - `_request_user_input`: Simulates a request for additional information from the user.

3. **Logging and Error Handling**:
   - Utilized logging for operational tracing and error diagnostics.
   - Code structured to minimize complexity.

4. **Reference File Analysis**:
   - The existing `AgentBase` class file was reviewed. There's no need to update it as the new agent extends functionality distinctly related to knowledge search independently from common agent functionalities already defined.

By creating the `KnowledgeAgent` in a new file (`knowledge_agent.py`), we keep functionality specific to knowledge interaction separate, while adhering to the codebase's best practices and design patterns.

### Plan and Implementation

1. **Integrate `KnowledgeDB` into `KnowledgeAgent`**:
   - Utilize `KnowledgeDB` to perform searches within the knowledge base.
   - Make sure to initialize `KnowledgeDB` in the `KnowledgeAgent` constructor using the settings from the session.

2. **Adjust `_perform_search` Method**:
   - Update `_perform_search` to use the `search` method of `KnowledgeDB`, passing a concatenated query of `conversation` and `request`.
   - Log necessary details regarding search results.
   - Handle exceptions specifically related to search operations in `KnowledgeDB`.

3. **Refactor `_is_confident_response`**:
   - Implement simple logic for determining response confidence, like checking the length of the response.
   - Ensure it's clear and modifiable for accommodating any future logic to determine confidence.

4. **Review and Apply Best Practices**:
   - Use proper logging with descriptive messages throughout the process for easier troubleshooting.
   - Add annotations for clarity, indicating data types for better maintenance and understanding.
   - Document code changes extensively, especially given the integration of new components.

By integrating the `KnowledgeDB`, the agent will now have the capability to effectively search the project's knowledge area, enhancing its functionality according to user requests.
