We must create an AzureDevopsManager class under codx/junior/azure package to access AzureDevops


First methods will be able to "read" pull requests from a pull request link.
The PAT token to access to Azure will be taken from git rremote url if present or project_git_token in the project settings (add to settings if not exists)

To fulfill the user's request, we'll create a new class called `AzureDevopsManager` in the `codx/junior/azure` package. This class will include methods required to "read" pull requests from a given pull request link. We'll ensure that the Personal Access Token (PAT) required to access Azure is retrieved either from the git remote URL or from a new entry in project settings. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Create the `AzureDevopsManager` Class:**
   - Implement this class in the `codx/junior/azure` package.
   - Add methods to read pull requests using a URL.

2. **Integration with Settings:**
   - Add a new entry in the project settings for `project_git_token` if it doesn't already exist.
   - Modify how the Azure access token is retrieved: check the git remote URL first, then fall back to `project_git_token`.

3. **Log and Document Code:**
   - Implement logging using the `logging` module to trace execution and handle errors gracefully.
   - Include type hints and docstrings for all methods and classes, ensuring clarity.

4. **Mermaid Diagrams & Best Practices:**
   - Use mermaid diagrams to illustrate complex logic if applicable.
   - Follow best practices mentioned for Python development.

Here's how the code would look for the new `AzureDevopsManager` class and the updates to settings:

```python
# New file: codx/junior/azure/azure_devops_manager.py

import logging
from typing import Optional

class AzureDevopsManager:
    """
    Class to manage interactions with Azure DevOps.
    
    This manager can read pull requests using a pull request URL.
    """

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the class here
        pass

    def get_pat_token(self) -> Optional[str]:
        """
        Retrieve the Personal Access Token (PAT) from git remote URL or project settings.
        
        Returns:
            Optional[str]: The PAT token if available, None otherwise.
        """
        try:
            # Try to retrieve PAT from git remote URL first
            # Fallback to project settings if not found
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error("Failed to retrieve PAT token: %s", e)
            return None

    def read_pull_request(self, pr_url: str):
        """
        Reads a pull request from the specified pull request URL.
        
        Args:
            pr_url (str): The URL of the pull request to read.
        """
        try:
            pat_token = self.get_pat_token()
            if not pat_token:
                raise ValueError("No PAT token available to access Azure DevOps")
            
            # Logic to read pull request using the `pr_url` and `pat_token` here
            pass
        except ValueError as ve:
            self.logger.warning("Value error occurred: %s", ve)
        except Exception as ex:
            self.logger.error("An error occurred when reading the pull request: %s", ex)

# Add the project_git_token to the settings if it doesn't exist
PROJECT_GIT_TOKEN = None  # Replace None with an actual token if needed
```

### Notes:
- Make sure to use appropriate error handling and logging for each critical operation.
- Additional logic to extract the PAT from the git remote URL or the project settings will need to be implemented within the methods.
- Replace placeholder logic with appropriate Azure DevOps API calls to fetch pull request details.
