To create the set of tests for the provided `mention_manager.py` functionality, we'll use Python's unittest framework. We will create a test suite that covers extracting mentions, mention flags, mention streaming, and ensuring that file changes generated do not include mention instructions. I will assume that the necessary environment and dependencies are available for testing.

Below is an example implementation for the tests:

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from mention_manager import MentionManager, Mention, MentionFlags

class TestMentionManager(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        # Set up mock managers
        chat_manager = MagicMock()
        profile_manager = MagicMock()
        event_manager = MagicMock()
        
        # Initialize MentionManager with mocked dependencies
        self.mention_manager = MentionManager(chat_manager, profile_manager, event_manager)

    def test_extract_mentions_single_line(self):
        content = "Some text @codx: mention content"
        mentions = self.mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
        
        self.assertEqual(len(mentions), 1)
        self.assertEqual(mentions[0].mention, "mention content")

    def test_extract_mentions_single_line_with_comment(self):
        content = "# Some comment related to @codx: another mention"
        mentions = self.mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
        
        self.assertEqual(len(mentions), 1)
        self.assertEqual(mentions[0].mention, "another mention")

    def test_extract_mentions_multi_line(self):
        content = "Some text\n<codx Start of mention\nContinued mention content\n</codx>"
        mentions = self.mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
        
        self.assertEqual(len(mentions), 1)
        self.assertIn("Start of mention", mentions[0].mention)

    def test_mention_flags(self):
        content = "@codx: --knowledge --model=gpt --chat-id=1234 --code"
        mentions = self.mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
        mention = mentions[0]

        self.assertTrue(mention.flags.knowledge)
        self.assertEqual(mention.flags.model, "gpt")
        self.assertEqual(mention.flags.chat_id, "1234")
        self.assertTrue(mention.flags.code)
        self.assertFalse(hasattr(mention.flags, 'image') and mention.flags.image)  # Ensure image is false by default

    def test_mentions_stream(self):
        # Testing for Presence of Mention Progress Streaming
        content = "Some initial text\n@codx: mention\nMore text"
        modified_content = self.mention_manager.notify_mentions_in_progress(content)
        
        # Check that content has been marked as "in progress"
        self.assertIn("@codx-ok, please-wait...:", modified_content)
        
    def test_file_changes_does_not_contain_mentions(self):
        content = """
        <codx Start of mention content
        More mention content
        </codx>
        Normal content
        """
  
        mentions = self.mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
        
        # Let's mock the changes generation and strip processes
        modified_content = self.mention_manager.strip_mentions(content, mentions)
        
        # Ensure the mention instructions are removed
        for mention in mentions:
            self.assertNotIn(mention.mention, modified_content)
    
# Run the tests
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

**Key Points:**
- **Setup**: Mocks are created for dependencies of `MentionManager`.
- **Single/Multi-Line Mentions**: Tests are designed to ensure mentions are correctly extracted, whether they start with `@codx:` or `<codx>`.
- **Mention Flags**: Verifies attributes in `MentionFlags` are correctly set.
- **Progress Notification**: Ensures content is marked as "in progress" correctly.
- **Input Verification**: Checks file/output change processes do not include the mention instructions.

Make sure to adjust the import paths according to the organization of your project when using this test suite. Also, the `unittest.main()` line will automatically discover and run all test methods that start with `test_`.

To create tests using the `pytest` framework for the functionality implemented in your `mention_manager.py`, we can follow a similar structure to the `unittest` setup, but leverage pytest's features. Pytest is known for its straightforward approach and powerful fixtures that simplify testing.

Here’s how you can accomplish this:

```python
# test_mention_manager.py

import pytest
from unittest.mock import MagicMock
from mention_manager import MentionManager, MentionFlags

@pytest.fixture
def mention_manager():
    # Mock dependencies
    chat_manager = MagicMock()
    profile_manager = MagicMock()
    event_manager = MagicMock()

    # Initialize MentionManager with mocked dependencies
    return MentionManager(chat_manager, profile_manager, event_manager)

def test_extract_single_line_mentions(mention_manager):
    content = "Some text @codx: mention content"
    mentions = mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
    
    assert len(mentions) == 1
    assert mentions[0].mention.strip() == "mention content"

def test_extract_comment_line_mentions(mention_manager):
    content = "# Some comment related to @codx: another mention"
    mentions = mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
    
    assert len(mentions) == 1
    assert mentions[0].mention.strip() == "another mention"

def test_extract_multi_line_mentions(mention_manager):
    content = """Some text
<codx Start of mention
Continued mention content
</codx>"""
    mentions = mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
    
    assert len(mentions) == 1
    assert "Start of mention" in mentions[0].mention

def test_mention_flags_extraction(mention_manager):
    content = "@codx: --knowledge --model=gpt --chat-id=1234 --code"
    mentions = mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
    mention = mentions[0]

    assert mention.flags.knowledge is True
    assert mention.flags.model == "gpt"
    assert mention.flags.chat_id == "1234"
    assert mention.flags.code is True
    assert not mention.flags.image  # Ensure image is false by default
 
def test_mentions_progress_streaming(mention_manager):
    content = "Some initial text\n@codx: mention\nMore text"
    modified_content = mention_manager.notify_mentions_in_progress(content)
    
    # Check content is marked as "in progress"
    assert "@codx-ok, please-wait...:" in modified_content
        
def test_file_changes_exclude_mentions(mention_manager):
    content = """
<codx Start of mention content
More mention content
</codx>
Normal content
"""
    mentions = mention_manager.extract_mentions(content)
    
    # Strip mentions from the provided content
    stripped_content = mention_manager.strip_mentions(content, mentions)
    
    # Ensure mention instructions are removed in final content
    for mention in mentions:
        assert mention.mention not in stripped_content

```

### Instructions and Setup:
- **Test Fixtures**: We use pytest's fixture mechanism to create an instance of `MentionManager` with mocked dependencies, reducing redundancy in test setup.
- **Assertion**: Pytest uses simple `assert` statements.
- **Testing Different Scenarios**: All required scenarios are covered such as single-line, multi-line mentions, and mention flag extraction, as well as ensuring that file changes do not contain mention instructions.
- **File Names and Directives**: Note that the `pytest` script must also include the name of the file being tested for your request; however, since these changes aren't being forced in code cells or affective runtime directly from a filename basis, this serves as a logistical note for script running and outer tooling or collections mentioned in your instructions.

### Running the Tests
To run these tests, ensure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then you can execute the test script using:

```bash
pytest test_mention_manager.py
```

This will identify and run all test functions prefixed with `test_`.
