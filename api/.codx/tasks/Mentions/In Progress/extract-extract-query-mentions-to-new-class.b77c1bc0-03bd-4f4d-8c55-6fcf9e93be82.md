To extract the `extract_query_mentions` function and its dependencies into a new class `ChatUtils`, we need to identify the dependencies and move them into a new class structure. Below, I've done this and shown how the code will look.

```python /shared/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/engine.py
import re
import logging
...

# New import statement to include ChatUtils
from codx.junior.utils.chat_utils import ChatUtils

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class CODXJuniorSession:
    def __init__(self,
            settings: CODXJuniorSettings = None,
            codx_path: str = None,
            channel: SessionChannel = None):
        ...
        self.chat_utils = ChatUtils(logger=logger)

    ...
 
    def get_query_mentions(self, query: str):
        return self.chat_utils.extract_query_mentions(query=query)

    ...

```

```python /shared/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/utils/chat_utils.py
import re
import logging

class ChatUtils:
    def __init__(self, logger=None):
        self.logger = logger or logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def extract_query_mentions(self, query: str):
        mentions = re.findall(r'@[a-zA-Z0-9\-\_\.]+', query)
        self.logger.info(f"Extracted mentions: {mentions}")
        return mentions

    def find_projects_by_mentions(self, mentions: [str]):
        return [project for project in [find_project_by_name(mention[1:]) for mention in mentions] if project]

    def find_profiles_by_mentions(self, mentions: [str]):
        profile_manager = self.get_profile_manager()
        profiles = profile_manager.list_profiles()
        mention_profiles = [p for p in profiles if p.name in mentions]
        return profile_manager.get_profiles_and_parents(mention_profiles)

```

In this refactor, I've created a new file `chat_utils.py` that contains the `ChatUtils` class. This class now contains the `extract_query_mentions` function and related helper functions.

We instantiate `ChatUtils` in the `CODXJuniorSession` class and use it for extracting mentions from the query. The rest of `CODXJuniorSession` can use this instance to handle tasks related to mentions and chats.
