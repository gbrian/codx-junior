To achieve this refactoring, we need to extract the project check and file changes logic from the existing class into a new class called `ChangeManager`. This means we have to encapsulate the file change detection and management functionalities in the new class while making sure that the operations are seamlessly integrated. Here's how the refactoring can be performed:

### Step 1: Create `ChangeManager` class

We'll create a new class `ChangeManager` inside the `codx/junior/changes/change_manager.py` file.

```python
# codx/junior/changes/change_manager.py

import os
import time
import logging
from codx.junior.knowledge.knowledge_milvus import Knowledge
from codx.junior.globals import MAX_OUTDATED_TIME_TO_PROCESS_FILE_CHANGE_IN_SECS

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ChangeManager:
    def __init__(self, settings, event_manager, mention_manager):
        self.settings = settings
        self.event_manager = event_manager
        self.mention_manager = mention_manager

    def check_project_changes(self):
        if not self.settings.is_valid_project():
            return False

        knowledge = Knowledge(settings=self.settings)
        knowledge.clean_deleted_documents()
        new_files = knowledge.detect_changes()
        
        if not new_files:
            logger.info(f"check_project_changes {self.settings.project_name} no changes")
            return False

        return True

    async def process_project_changes(self):
        if not self.settings.is_valid_project():
            return

        knowledge = Knowledge(settings=self.settings)
        knowledge.clean_deleted_documents()
        new_files, _ = knowledge.detect_changes()
        if not new_files:
            return    

        def changed_file():
            for file_path in new_files:
                if (int(time.time()) - int(os.stat(file_path).st_mtime) < MAX_OUTDATED_TIME_TO_PROCESS_FILE_CHANGE_IN_SECS):
                    return file_path
            return None

        file_path = changed_file()  # process one file at a time by modified time
        if not file_path:
            return

        logger.info(f"[process_project_changes] Processing file changes {file_path}")
        res = await self.mention_manager.check_file_for_mentions(file_path=file_path)
        if res == "processing":
            logger.info(f"[process_project_changes] Skipping file {file_path} - mentions: {res}")
            return

        if self.settings.watching:
            logger.info(f"Reload knowledge files {file_path}")
            knowledge.reload_path(path=file_path)
            self.event_manager.send_knowled_event(type="loaded", file_path=file_path)
```

### Step 2: Integrate `ChangeManager` into `CODXJuniorSession`

Now, we need to update the `CODXJuniorSession` class to use the `ChangeManager` class.

```python
# Inside /shared/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/engine.py

from codx.junior.changes.change_manager import ChangeManager

class CODXJuniorSession:
    def __init__(self, settings: CODXJuniorSettings = None, codx_path: str = None, channel: SessionChannel = None):
        self.settings = settings or CODXJuniorSettings.from_project_file(f"{codx_path}/project.json")
        self.channel = channel
        self.event_manager = EventManager(codx_path=codx_path, channel=channel)
        self.mention_manager = MentionManager(settings=self.settings, chat_manager=self.get_chat_manager(), profile_manager=self.get_profile_manager(), event_manager=self.event_manager)
        self.change_manager = ChangeManager(self.settings, self.event_manager, self.mention_manager)

    def check_project_changes(self):
        return self.change_manager.check_project_changes()
    
    async def process_project_changes(self):
        await self.change_manager.process_project_changes()
```

### Step 3: Adjust any calls to new methods

Make sure that anywhere in your codebase where `check_project_changes` or `process_project_changes` methods were being called should now be updated to use their new implementations inside the `CODXJuniorSession` class where they call methods on the `ChangeManager` instance.

---

This refactoring ensures that project file change logic is encapsulated in its own class which can be tested and maintained independently from the session-based logic. This enhancement adds modularity and clarity to your codebase.
