description: '1. The user provided a detailed Python class `Engine` with methods for
  Git operations, file handling, and project analysis.

  2. They asked for a structured representation (AST-style tree) of the class and
  its methods.

  3. A tree diagram was generated showing the class structure, including methods like
  `get_project_branches`, `build_code_changes_summary`, and `run_app`.

  4. The user also requested a summary of the conversation.

  5. A 5-line summary was provided to encapsulate the key points of the interaction.'
