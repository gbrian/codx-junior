To create an `mcp_server.py` file that exposes the existing FastAPI application endpoints through an MCP server, you need to follow the steps of setting up an MCP server and mapping the MCP commands to your existing API endpoints. Here is an example implementation:

```python /shared/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/mcp_server.py
import asyncio
import requests
from codx.junior.api.codx.junior.app import app

class MCPServerProtocol(asyncio.Protocol):
    def connection_made(self, transport):
        self.transport = transport
        print('Connection established')

    def data_received(self, data):
        message = data.decode()
        print(f'Received message: {message}')
        response = self.handle_message(message)
        self.transport.write(response.encode())

    def handle_message(self, message):
        # Map MCP commands to FastAPI endpoints
        if message.startswith('GET /api/health'):
            return self.call_api_health_check()
        elif message.startswith('GET /api/knowledge/status'):
            return self.call_api_knowledge_status()
        # Add more command mappings here
        return 'Unknown command'

    def call_api_health_check(self):
        # Call the FastAPI health check endpoint
        response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health')
        return response.text

    def call_api_knowledge_status(self):
        # Call the FastAPI knowledge status endpoint
        response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/knowledge/status')
        return response.json()

async def main():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    server = await loop.create_server(
        lambda: MCPServerProtocol(),
        '127.0.0.1', 8888  # MCP server will listen on port 8888
    )
    async with server:
        await server.serve_forever()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Explanation:

1. **MCPServerProtocol Class**:
   - This class is derived from `asyncio.Protocol` and is responsible for handling MCP connections.
   - `connection_made`: Called when a connection is established.
   - `data_received`: Called when data is received from the client. It decodes the message and processes it.
   - `handle_message`: Maps the MCP commands to your FastAPI endpoints and sends the appropriate response.
   - `call_api_health_check` and `call_api_knowledge_status`: These methods make HTTP requests to the FastAPI application to fetch the required data.

2. **Server Setup**:
   - The server is created using `asyncio` and listens on `127.0.0.1:8888`.
   - The `main` function sets up the server and runs it indefinitely.

3. **Running the Server**:
   - To run this MCP server, execute the `mcp_server.py` file. Make sure your FastAPI application is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or adjust the URL accordingly.

This setup allows you to expose your FastAPI endpoints via an MCP server, enabling multi-channel protocol communications. Adjust the message handling and endpoint calls to match your specific requirements and add more mappings as needed.
