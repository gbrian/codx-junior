Develop a method within the agent to effectively summarize conversations from the comments. The summarization should accurately capture the main points and detailed aspects of the issue. This will involve extracting key information and presenting it concisely.

@codx-api to implementÂ GitIssuesAgent summarization we'll need to use CODXJuniorSession::get_ai 
* we'll iterate over all messages and call ai.chat(prompt=f"Summarize in 5 lines this message: {message}")
* return a list of IssueComment

To implement the summarization of GitHub issue comments in the `GitIssuesAgent` class using the `CODXJuniorSession::get_ai` method, we can follow these steps. Here we'll make sure to iterate over all comments to summarize them using AI, and then return a list of `IssueComment` objects. Let's proceed by updating the `summarize_conversation` method and defining the `IssueComment` class properly.

### Key Enhancements Made:

- **Logging**: Enhanced logging has been added at various stages of the processing to help in debugging and tracing the execution flow.
- **AI-Based Comment Summarization**: The `summarize_conversation` method now uses AI to summarize each comment, constructing a list of `IssueComment` objects containing the author, message, and summary.
- **Exception Handling**: Code robustness has been increased by adding error handling during the summarization process.
- **Code Documentation**: Each function is thoroughly documented and relevant comments have been added for complex parts of the code logic.
