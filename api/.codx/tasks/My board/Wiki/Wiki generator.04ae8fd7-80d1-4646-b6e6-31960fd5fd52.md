We are going to create a wiki generator module for the project, It''ll be converting project changes into documentation. Will use tasks with messages marked as "is_knowledge" as well to document project requirements, for the latest it will first convert the task into "User knowledge" document with specific format.

To address the user request and structure the requirements into clear, detailed tasks using the provided template, we can break down the project into the following tasks. This approach ensures that all user comments are retained and integrated into a structured format.

### Task 1: Develop the Wiki Generator Module

#### Objective
- **Mermaid Diagram**: 
  ```
  classDiagram
    class WikiGeneratorModule {
      +generateWikiFromChanges()
      +convertToDocumentation()
      +integrateTasks()
    }
  ```
  - The main goal of the task is to create a module that converts project changes into documentation, ensuring that any updates in the project are accurately reflected in the wiki.

#### Requirements
- Create a function to track and capture project changes.
- Implement an interface to convert changes into structured wiki documentation.
  
#### Acceptance Criteria
- The module should automatically update the wiki when project changes occur.
- Documentation should be clear, concise, and reflect the latest project modifications.

#### Definition of done
Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked:
 * [X] Capture and track project changes functionality developed
 * [] Conversion of changes to documentation completed
 * [] Successful integration with existing documentation systems

---

### Task 2: Implement "User Knowledge" Document Conversion

#### Objective
- **Mermaid Diagram**:
  ```
  sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant System
    User->>System: Submit task marked as "is_knowledge"
    System->>WikiGeneratorModule: Convert task to "User Knowledge"
  ```
  - The goal is to process tasks with messages marked as "is_knowledge" and convert them into "User Knowledge" documents using a specific format.

#### Requirements
- Develop a parser for tasks marked as "is_knowledge".
- Design a format for "User Knowledge" documents to ensure consistent documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Tasks marked as "is_knowledge" are converted into "User Knowledge" documents.
- The format is easy to read and follows predefined documentation standards.

#### Definition of done
Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked:
 * [] Parser for "is_knowledge" tasks is operational
 * [] "User Knowledge" format is developed and standardized
 * [] Successful conversion and storage of tasks into the new format

---

### Task 3: Integrate Tasks with Existing Documentation System

#### Objective
- **Mermaid Diagram**:
  ```
  mindmap
    root((Wiki Generator))
      IntegrateTasksWithDocSystem
        AddIntegrationLayer
        TestIntegrationCorrectness
  ```
  - The aim is to ensure that the wiki generator module seamlessly integrates with the existing documentation system to handle project requirements.

#### Requirements
- Analyze existing documentation systems for integration compatibility.
- Develop integration points for the generator module.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- The system can update and retrieve documentation through the new module.
- There is no data loss or format issue in the documentation.

#### Definition of done
Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked:
 * [] Integration layer developed
 * [] Module communicates correctly with existing systems
 * [] Tests show successful data transfer and format maintenance

By structuring the project into these tasks, each with clear objectives, requirements, and criteria for completion, we provide a roadmap for developing a robust wiki generator module that meets the userâ€™s needs.
