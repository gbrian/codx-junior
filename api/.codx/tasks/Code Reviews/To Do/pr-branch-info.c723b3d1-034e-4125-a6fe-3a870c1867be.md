For the PR review we must return all files changed between two branches. Method will receive the base branch and the target branch like: "from: develop, to: master" meaning we want to see changes in the develop branch that will be merged into master.
For each file we'll return:
 * file name
 * status: new, modified, deleted
 * diff
 * commits: list of all commits in "from" branch where this file has been changed

To implement the method for PR review that returns all files changed between two branches, we can make use of Git commands to retrieve the necessary information. Here's how you can implement this functionality:

```python /shared/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/engine.py
def get_pr_review_details(self, from_branch: str, to_branch: str):
    # Switch to the target branch to ensure we are comparing correctly
    exec_command(f"git checkout {to_branch}", cwd=self.settings.project_path)

    # Get the list of files changed between the two branches
    diff_command = f"git diff --name-status {to_branch}..{from_branch}"
    stdout, _ = exec_command(diff_command, cwd=self.settings.project_path)
    file_changes = stdout.strip().split('\n')

    # Prepare the list to hold the changes
    changes = []

    for line in file_changes:
        if line:
            status, file_path = line.split('\t', 1)
            file_status = 'modified'
            if status == 'A':
                file_status = 'new'
            elif status == 'D':
                file_status = 'deleted'

            # Get the diff for the file
            file_diff_command = f"git diff {to_branch}..{from_branch} -- {file_path}"
            file_diff, _ = exec_command(file_diff_command, cwd=self.settings.project_path)

            # Get the commits for the file
            file_commits_command = f"git log --oneline {to_branch}..{from_branch} -- {file_path}"
            file_commits_stdout, _ = exec_command(file_commits_command, cwd=self.settings.project_path)
            file_commits = file_commits_stdout.strip().split('\n')

            changes.append({
                'file_name': file_path,
                'status': file_status,
                'diff': file_diff,
                'commits': file_commits
            })

    return changes
```

### Explanation:
- **Checkout to the Target Branch:** We first ensure that we are in the correct branch context by checking out to the `to_branch`.
- **File Changes:** We use `git diff --name-status` to get the list of files that have changed between the two branches along with their status (added, modified, deleted).
- **File Diff:** For each file, we get the diff using `git diff` for the specific file path.
- **File Commits:** We retrieve the list of commits affecting each file using `git log`.

This method will return a list of dictionaries, each containing the file name, its status, the diff, and the list of commits affecting that file.

Do we have to checkout target branch or is enough with a "pull" of the branches, don'yt want to change current branch

### Explanation:
- **Fetch Branches:** Instead of checking out to the target branch, we fetch the latest changes from both branches. This way, we don't alter the current branch context.
- **File Changes:** We use `git diff --name-status` to get the list of files that have changed between the two branches along with their status (added, modified, deleted).
- **File Diff:** For each file, we get the diff using `git diff` for the specific file path.
- **File Commits:** We retrieve the list of commits affecting each file using `git log`.

This method will return a list of dictionaries, each containing the file name, its status, the diff, and the list of commits affecting that file.
