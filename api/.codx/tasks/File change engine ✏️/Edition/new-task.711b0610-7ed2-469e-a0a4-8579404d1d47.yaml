description: The document outlines various methods for expressing and applying patches
  to file content, including the Unified Diff Format, JSON Patch, Custom Markup Language,
  Patch Objects, Scripting Language, Annotations, Version Control Hooks, Interactive
  Patch Application, and Template-Based Changes. However, the instructions specify
  to discard approaches that rely on line numbers, are specific to file types, or
  use custom scripts. The task is to update the document accordingly and return the
  revised content.

    When asking AI to make changes on a file content it can require modify, add or
    delete some parts of the document.



    We need a format to express these changes and a strategy to apply them.

- content: "Here is a list of ideas for expressing and applying patches to file content:\n\
    \n1. **Unified Diff Format**:\n   - **Expression**: Use the unified diff format\
    \ to express changes. This format includes lines prefixed with `+` for additions,\
    \ `-` for deletions, and no prefix for unchanged lines.\n   - **Strategy**: Use\
    \ a diff tool or library to apply the diff to the original file, automatically\
    \ updating the content.\n\n2. **JSON Patch**:\n   - **Expression**: Represent\
    \ changes using JSON Patch, which is a standard format for expressing a sequence\
    \ of operations to apply to a JSON document.\n   - **Strategy**: Utilize a JSON\
    \ Patch library to apply the operations to the file content, which should be in\
    \ JSON format.\n\n3. **Custom Markup Language**:\n   - **Expression**: Develop\
    \ a simple markup language to describe changes, such as `ADD`, `REMOVE`, and `MODIFY`\
    \ commands with line numbers and content.\n   - **Strategy**: Write a parser to\
    \ interpret the markup and apply the changes to the file.\n\n4. **Line Number\
    \ and Content Mapping**:\n   - **Expression**: List changes with line numbers\
    \ and the new content for each line that needs to be modified.\n   - **Strategy**:\
    \ Iterate through the file, applying changes to the specified lines.\n\n5. **Patch\
    \ Objects**:\n   - **Expression**: Create patch objects that encapsulate the type\
    \ of change (add, remove, modify), target location, and content.\n   - **Strategy**:\
    \ Implement a function that processes these patch objects and modifies the file\
    \ accordingly.\n\n6. **Scripting Language**:\n   - **Expression**: Use a scripting\
    \ language like Python or JavaScript to write scripts that define the changes.\n\
    \   - **Strategy**: Execute the script to apply the changes directly to the file.\n\
    \n7. **Annotations in the File**:\n   - **Expression**: Insert annotations or\
    \ comments directly in the file that specify changes (e.g., `// ADD: new code\
    \ here`).\n   - **Strategy**: Use a pre-processor to read these annotations and\
    \ apply the changes during a build or update process.\n\n8. **Version Control\
    \ Hooks**:\n   - **Expression**: Utilize version control systems like Git to handle\
    \ patches through commits and branches.\n   - **Strategy**: Apply patches by merging\
    \ branches or applying specific commits that contain the desired changes.\n\n\
    9. **Interactive Patch Application**:\n   - **Expression**: Provide an interactive\
    \ interface for users to manually select and apply changes.\n   - **Strategy**:\
    \ Use a GUI or terminal-based tool that allows users to preview and apply patches\
    \ interactively.\n\n10. **Template-Based Changes**:\n    - **Expression**: Use\
    \ templates with placeholders for dynamic content that needs to be updated.\n\
    \    - **Strategy**: Apply changes by rendering templates with the new content\
    \ as needed. \n\nThese ideas offer a range of approaches, from automated tools\
    \ to manual interventions, to effectively manage and apply patches to file content."
