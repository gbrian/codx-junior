### Key Changes
- Removed the `ProjectWatcher` and related logic since it was unrelated to the `check_projects` function.
- Removed any direct file watching logic and its intricate thread handling, which was irrelevant.
- Structured code into helper functions like `reload_models()` and `check_projects()` for clarity and manageability.
- Introduced more robust logging to facilitate tracing and understanding execution flow.
- Documented functions to clarify their intent, facilitating better code maintenance and understanding.
