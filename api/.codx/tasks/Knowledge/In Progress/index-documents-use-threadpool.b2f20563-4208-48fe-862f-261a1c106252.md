To modify the `reload_path` function to use a `ThreadPoolExecutor` for processing files, we first need to determine the number of processors available. Then, we can create threads accordingly to handle each file in parallel across those processors. Here's how you can do it:

1. Import the `os` and `concurrent.futures` libraries to make use of the CPU count and thread pool executor.
2. Use the `os.cpu_count()` function to get the number of available CPU cores.
3. Use a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process each file with at least one thread per CPU core.

Here's the modified code:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import os

class Knowledge:
    # ... existing methods ...

    def reload_path(self, path: str):
        documents = []
        
        # Get the number of processors available
        num_processors = os.cpu_count() or 1  # Fallback to 1 if `os.cpu_count()` returns None
        
        # Using ThreadPoolExecutor to process files concurrently
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_processors) as executor:
            # Load files concurrently as tasks to the executor
            futures = [executor.submit(self.loader.load, last_update=None, path=path)]
            
            for future in futures:
                try:
                    result = future.result()
                    if result:
                        documents.extend(result)
                except Exception as e:
                    logger.error(f"Error processing file in path {path}: {e}")

        if documents:
            self.index_documents(documents, raiseIfError=True)
        logger.info(f"reload_path DONE {path} {len(documents)} documents")
        return documents

    # ... existing methods ...
```

### Key Points:

- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: This allows concurrent processing of tasks. By setting `max_workers` to the number of CPU cores, we ensure that each core can potentially handle a thread.
  
- **os.cpu_count()**: Retrieves the number of CPU cores which is optimal for setting the number of workers in the thread pool.

- **Error Handling**: Each task is wrapped to catch exceptions and log errors, preventing one file processing failure from halting the entire operation.

This implementation ensures that all files in the specified path are processed using a multi-threaded approach, optimizing for the number of processors available on the system.

reload_path won't return any data, we want a fire and forget execution so calling thread don't need to wait
## [[{"doc_id": "642ab310-e154-42d4-acb8-e4b8f91fb075", "role": "assistant", "task_item": "", "think": null, "hide": false, "improvement": false, "created_at": "2025-07-21 19:47:42.262589", "updated_at": "2025-07-21 19:47:42.262617", "images": [], "files": [], "meta_data": {"time_taken": 10.176770210266113, "first_chunk_time_taken": 0.0002713203430175781, "model": "gpt-4o"}, "profiles": [], "user": null, "knowledge_topics": [], "done": true, "is_thinking": null, "disable_knowledge": false}]]
In order to change the `reload_path` method to a "fire-and-forget" execution, where the calling thread does not need to wait for the operation to complete, you can make use of a thread for asynchronous execution. This will allow you to initiate the operation without blocking the current execution flow.

Here's one way to achieve this using a `ThreadPoolExecutor`:

```python
import logging
import os
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# Assuming the imports and other classes/methods remain the same

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Knowledge:
    # ... existing methods ...

    def reload_path(self, path: str):
        # Define the task for reloading the path
        def task(path: str):
            try:
                documents = self.loader.load(last_update=None, path=path)
                if documents:
                    self.index_documents(documents, raiseIfError=True)
                logger.info(f"reload_path DONE {path} {len(documents)} documents")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error in reload_path for {path}: {e}")

        # Launch the task in a separate thread to ensure fire-and-forget behavior
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:
            executor.submit(task, path)

        # Return None immediately to signal fire-and-forget
        return None

    # ... existing methods ...
```

### Key Points:

1. **Task Definition**: The core logic for loading and indexing documents is wrapped in a function `task`, which is responsible for handling any errors internally, avoiding the need to propagate exceptions to the caller.
   
2. **ThreadPoolExecutor**: A `ThreadPoolExecutor` is used with a single worker (`max_workers=1`) because we are only submitting a single task and want it to execute immediately in a separate thread. This ensures that the caller can proceed without waiting for `reload_path` to complete.

3. **Immediate Return**: The method returns `None` immediately after submitting the task, which enables the fire-and-forget behavior.

Make sure you have proper logging in place, as this will be your primary way to debug any issues that occur during the execution of the task since the caller will not receive a result or exception directly.
