To parallelize the `process_project_change` calls in the script, we will use the `asyncio` library to schedule these tasks concurrently. This allows us to take advantage of concurrency within the `async/await` syntax. Here's a step-by-step way to modify the script:

1. **Import asyncio**: First, ensure that you have imported `asyncio` at the top of the script.

2. **Modify the `process_project_changes` method**: Instead of waiting for each call to `process_project_change` to complete before moving to the next, we will gather the tasks and run them concurrently.

Here's the updated implementation:

### Explanation:

- **Tasks List**: A list named `tasks` is created to hold the coroutine objects for each file that needs to be processed. 

- **Appending Tasks**: For every file that needs to be processed, a coroutine is appended to the `tasks` list instead of awaiting it immediately. 

- **`asyncio.gather`**: This function is used to schedule and run all the coroutines in the `tasks` list concurrently. Once all coroutines are completed, `await asyncio.gather(*tasks)` resumes execution. 

This change will enable multiple file changes to be processed concurrently, significantly increasing throughput in environments where there are many changes to process.

Will running them in an independent thread improve performance?

Running the `process_project_change` calls in independent threads versus using `asyncio` depends on several factors, including the nature of the tasks and how they manage I/O and CPU. Here's a breakdown of considerations that can help determine whether using threads would improve performance:

### 1. Nature of Tasks
- **I/O-bound tasks**: If the `process_project_change` tasks are primarily waiting on I/O operations (such as file I/O, network calls, or database access), then using `asyncio` with `async/await` is typically more appropriate. This is because `asyncio` is efficient in handling I/O-bound tasks by allowing other tasks to run while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
- **CPU-bound tasks**: If the tasks are compute-intensive and spend a lot of time on CPU processing, threading (or multiprocessing) can be more beneficial. Threads can run concurrently on multiple CPU cores, providing a performance boost for CPU-bound workloads.

### 2. Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- Python's GIL effectively ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecodes at a time. This means that multi-threading in Python isn't always helpful for CPU-bound tasks because threads can't truly run in parallel.
- If `process_project_change` is CPU-bound, consider using multiprocessing instead of multithreading, as multiprocessing would allow the program to utilize multiple CPU cores and run tasks in parallel without being constrained by the GIL.

### 3. Context Switching Overheads
- Threads come with context-switching overheads. Managing a large number of threads can become inefficient due to these overheads. 
- `asyncio` manages concurrency with a single-threaded event loop, which can be more efficient for numerous small tasks that are largely I/O-bound.

### 4. Simplicity and Maintainability
- `asyncio` tends to be simpler and more maintainable for I/O-bound tasks due to the single-threaded nature and the use of coroutines that are easier to reason about compared to managing many threads and ensuring thread safety.

### Implementation Consideration for Threads
If you determine that using threads (or multiprocessing) might improve performance, Python's `concurrent.futures` module provides a `ThreadPoolExecutor` and a `ProcessPoolExecutor` for managing threads and processes, respectively.

Here's how you could use `ThreadPoolExecutor`:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import asyncio

# Assume that process_project_change has been adjusted to a synchronous function for threading
def process_project_change_thread(file_path: str):
    # Synchronous implementation of process_project_change
    pass  # Replace with actual logic

async def process_project_changes(self):
    if not self.settings.is_valid_project():
        return

    self.knowledge.clean_deleted_documents()
    new_files, _ = self.knowledge.detect_changes()
    if not new_files:
        return

    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        tasks = [
            loop.run_in_executor(executor, process_project_change_thread, file_path)
            for file_path in new_files
        ]

        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)  # Run threads and wait for completion
```

### Final Thoughts
Before deciding to switch to threads or processes, carefully analyze the nature of tasks and where the bottlenecks occur. If `process_project_change` heavily relies on I/O, sticking with `asyncio` is often the best choice.
