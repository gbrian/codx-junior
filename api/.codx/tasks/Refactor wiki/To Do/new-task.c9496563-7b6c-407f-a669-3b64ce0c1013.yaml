description: In this conversation, we discussed modifications to the `WikiManager`
  class to eliminate its dependency on VitePress. The goal was to simplify its responsibilities
  to creating configurations, building a home page with project overviews, and generating
  category files. I provided an updated version of the `WikiManager` class featuring
  straightforward methods for these tasks, focusing on using plain JSON files and
  Markdown for documentation. The updated class reflects a leaner design, focusing
  solely on essential functions without external framework dependencies.
