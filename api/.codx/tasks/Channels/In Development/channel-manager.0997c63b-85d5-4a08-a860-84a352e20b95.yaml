    #### Overview


    The `GroupChats` manager is an extension to the existing chat functionality within
    the `codx-api`. It aims to manage group chats, akin to channels in Slack, enhancing
    collaboration among team members. Each `GroupChat` will manage a collection of
    user messages, track visibility, and maintain a list of participants. The `GroupChat`
    enhances the current `Chat` class by introducing additional fields and functionality.


    #### Key Components


    1. **GroupChat Class**:

    - Extends the existing `Chat` class.

    - Adds a `users` list to maintain participants.

    - Adds a `visibility` attribute with options `public` or `private`.


    2. **GroupChats Manager**:

    - Responsible for creating, updating, and managing `GroupChat` instances.

    - Provides APIs to add/remove users, change visibility, and manage chat messages.


    3. **FASTAPI Router**:

    - Exposes endpoints to create and update group chats.

    - Provides a RESTful interface for interacting with group chats.


    4. **Service Layer**:

    - Implements the business logic for handling group chat operations.

    - Manages data persistence and retrieval.


    5. **Data Model**:

    - Defines the structure of the `GroupChat` entity.

    - Ensures data consistency and integrity.


    #### High-Level Design


    Below is a high-level architecture diagram illustrating interaction within the
    `GroupChats` module:


    ```mermaid

    classDiagram

    class Chat {

    +String id

    +String board

    +String column

    +String name

    +DateTime created_at

    +DateTime updated_at

    +List~Message~ messages

    +serializeChat()

    +find_by_id(chat_id: String)

    +get_chat_file(Chat): String

    }


    class GroupChat {

    +List~User~ users

    +String visibility

    }


    Chat <|-- GroupChat


    class GroupChatsManager {

    +createGroupChat(name: String, users: List~User~, visibility: String): GroupChat

    +addUserToChat(chatId: String, user: User): void

    +removeUserFromChat(chatId: String, user: User): void

    +updateChatVisibility(chatId: String, visibility: String): void

    +listGroupChats(): List~GroupChat~

    +findGroupChatById(id: String): GroupChat

    }


    GroupChatsManager --> GroupChat


    User o-- GroupChat


    class FASTAPIRouter {

    +createGroupChatEndpoint(groupChatData): Response

    +updateGroupChatEndpoint(chatId, groupChatData): Response

    }


    FASTAPIRouter --> GroupChatsManager


    class GroupChatService {

    +createGroupChat(name: String, users: List~User~, visibility: String): GroupChat

    +updateGroupChat(chatId: String, data): GroupChat

    }


    GroupChatService --> GroupChatsManager

    ```


    #### Process for Managing Group Chats


    1. **Create GroupChat**:

    - Initialize a `GroupChat` instance extending the `Chat` functionality.

    - Assign a unique identifier, initial list of users, and set visibility.


    2. **Manage Users in GroupChat**:

    - Functionality for adding and removing users from a specific chat.

    - Ensure user list is updated and notifications are sent where applicable.


    3. **Change Visibility**:

    - Ability to toggle a `GroupChat` between `public` and `private`.

    - Implement visibility constraints, ensuring only authorized users can make changes.


    4. **Message Management**:

    - Use existing message functionalities from `Chat`.

    - Maintain message integrity across users, ensuring synchronization.


    5. **Listing and Finding GroupChats**:

    - Provide methods to list all available `GroupChat` instances.

    - Search and retrieve specific `GroupChat` details using identifiers.


    6. **FASTAPI Endpoints**:

    - Create group chat through a POST request.

    - Update group chat details with a PUT/PATCH request.

    - Ensure endpoints are secured and validated.


    ### Objective

    - Develop the GroupChat module based on the existing Chat class.

    - Implement user management and visibility functions.


    ### Requirements

    - Enable creation of group chats with initial users and visibility flags.

    - Support dynamic user addition and removal from group chats.


    ### Acceptance Criteria

    - A GroupChat can be created with a list of users and a visibility flag.

    - Users can be successfully added and removed from chats.

    - Visibility of a group chat can be toggled between public and private.


    ### Definition of Done

    Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked

    * [] GroupChat class extending Chat is created

    * [] Users can be added and removed in GroupChat

    * [] Visibility toggle feature is implemented

    * [] GroupChats can be listed and retrieved

    * [] FASTAPI endpoints for creation and update are implemented

    * [] Test cases covering all functionalities are passed
