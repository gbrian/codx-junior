We need a GroupChats manager for teams
A GroupChat will extend Chat and add users list and visibility (public, private)
We must manage a collection of GroupChat as they were slack channels where multiple users can chat and sahre information

### GroupChats Manager Architecture for `codx-api`

#### Overview

The `GroupChats` manager is an extension to the existing chat functionality within the `codx-api`. It aims to manage group chats, akin to channels in Slack, enhancing collaboration among team members. Each `GroupChat` will manage a collection of user messages, track visibility, and maintain a list of participants. The `GroupChat` enhances the current `Chat` class by introducing additional fields and functionality.

#### Key Components

1. **GroupChat Class**:
   - Extends the existing `Chat` class.
   - Adds a `users` list to maintain participants.
   - Adds a `visibility` attribute with options `public` or `private`.

2. **GroupChats Manager**:
   - Responsible for creating, updating, and managing `GroupChat` instances.
   - Provides APIs to add/remove users, change visibility, and manage chat messages.

#### High-Level Design

Below is a high-level architecture diagram illustrating interaction within the `GroupChats` module:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Chat {
        +String id
        +String board
        +String column
        +String name
        +DateTime created_at
        +DateTime updated_at
        +List~Message~ messages
        +serializeChat()
        +find_by_id(chat_id: String)
        +get_chat_file(Chat): String
    }

    class GroupChat {
        +List~User~ users
        +String visibility
    }

    Chat <|-- GroupChat

    class GroupChatsManager {
        +createGroupChat(name: String, users: List~User~, visibility: String): GroupChat
        +addUserToChat(chatId: String, user: User): void
        +removeUserFromChat(chatId: String, user: User): void
        +updateChatVisibility(chatId: String, visibility: String): void
        +listGroupChats(): List~GroupChat~
        +findGroupChatById(id: String): GroupChat
    }
    
    GroupChatsManager --> GroupChat

    User o-- GroupChat
```

#### Process for Managing Group Chats

1. **Create GroupChat**:
   - Initialize a `GroupChat` instance extending the `Chat` functionality.
   - Assign a unique identifier, initial list of users, and set visibility.

2. **Manage Users in GroupChat**:
   - Functionality for adding and removing users from a specific chat.
   - Ensure user list is updated and notifications are sent where applicable.

3. **Change Visibility**:
   - Ability to toggle a `GroupChat` between `public` and `private`.
   - Implement visibility constraints, ensuring only authorized users can make changes.

4. **Message Management**:
   - Use existing message functionalities from `Chat`.
   - Maintain message integrity across users, ensuring synchronization.

5. **Listing and Finding GroupChats**:
   - Provide methods to list all available `GroupChat` instances.
   - Search and retrieve specific `GroupChat` details using identifiers.

#### Task Example

```md
### Objective
- Develop the GroupChat module based on the existing Chat class.
- Implement user management and visibility functions.

### Requirements
- Enable creation of group chats with initial users and visibility flags.
- Support dynamic user addition and removal from group chats.

### Acceptance Criteria
- A GroupChat can be created with a list of users and a visibility flag.
- Users can be successfully added and removed from chats.
- Visibility of a group chat can be toggled between public and private.

### Definition of Done
Task will be considered done once all list entries are checked
 * [] GroupChat class extending Chat is created
 * [] Users can be added and removed in GroupChat
 * [] Visibility toggle feature is implemented
 * [] GroupChats can be listed and retrieved
 * [] Test cases covering all functionalities are passed
```

For the group_chats we need:
 * FASTAPI router for endpoints: create, update
 * service for managing the logic
 * data model
