- content: "@codx-api\_\nHelp me \"brainstorming\" how to manage the wiki generation\
    \ for a project.\nEach project has a \"project_wiki\" setting to indicate if the\
    \ user wants to generate a wiki from thr project's files\n\n\nIf the project has\
    \ a wiki path setting we'll initialize that directory with the vitepress engine.\n\
    Afterwards we need to understand what kind of project is and define a config.\n\
    \n\nAnd have a method to process last changes and rebuild the wiki parts modified.\n\
    \n\nWe must define the kind of project:\n\_ then we must define the wiki structure\
    \ (config)\n\_ \_ \_ then we must define the files that will be used for each\
    \ wiki entry\n\n\nExample:\n\"codx-api project is a FastAPI python project with\
    \ classes and methods to interact with codx-junior. We'll generate a wiki to help\
    \ other developers to use the API (endpoints) and to understand the classes and\
    \ functions.\"\n\n\nSo we'll define, for example a config with endpoint, classes\
    \ by functionality, utilities and examples; for each section we'll have a file\
    \ in mardown,\_\nthen we'll process each file in the project and decide which\
    \ wiki file or files are affected and updated.\n\n\nWhen defining the config we'll\
    \ have comments explaining each section and the rules that a file must match to\
    \ add content to that file\n\n\nWe need a diagram to express the logic.\n\n\n\
    Vitepress config example\n```config.js\nimport fs from 'fs'\nimport path from\
    \ 'path'\nimport { defineConfigWithTheme, type HeadConfig, type Plugin } from\
    \ 'vitepress'\nimport type { Config as ThemeConfig } from '@vue/theme'\nimport\
    \ llmstxt from 'vitepress-plugin-llms'\nimport baseConfig from '@vue/theme/config'\n\

- content: "Certainly! Let's break down the process of managing wiki generation for\
    \ a project, specifically focusing on initializing the wiki directory with Vitepress,\
    \ defining the project structure, and processing changes to rebuild the wiki.\n\
    \n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Initialize Wiki Directory**:\n   - If the project\
    \ has a `project_wiki` setting, initialize the wiki directory using Vitepress.\n\
    \   - Create a `home.md` file in the wiki directory to serve as the main entry\
    \ point.\n\n2. **Define Project Structure**:\n   - Identify the type of project\
    \ (e.g., FastAPI Python project).\n   - Define a configuration that specifies\
    \ the structure of the wiki, including sections like endpoints, classes, utilities,\
    \ and examples.\n   - Each section should have a corresponding markdown file.\n\
    \n3. **Process File Changes**:\n   - Monitor the project files for changes.\n\
    \   - When a change is detected, extract relevant parts from the changed file\
    \ and add them to the appropriate wiki file.\n   - Use Vitepress to rebuild the\
    \ wiki to reflect the changes.\n\n### Example Configuration\n\nHere\u2019s an\
    \ example configuration for a FastAPI Python project:\n\n```python\n# codx_junior/api/codx/junior/engine.py\n\
    \nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport markdown\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nclass\
    \ WikiManager:\n    def __init__(self, settings):\n        self.settings = settings\n\
    \        self.wiki_path = settings.get_project_wiki_path()\n\n    def initialize_wiki(self):\n\
    \        if not self.settings.project_wiki:\n            return\n\n        # Initialize\
    \ wiki directory\n        if not os.path.exists(self.wiki_path):\n           \
    \ os.makedirs(self.wiki_path)\n\n        # Create home.md file\n        home_md_path\
    \ = os.path.join(self.wiki_path, 'home.md')\n        if not os.path.exists(home_md_path):\n\
    \            with open(home_md_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n          \
    \      f.write(f\"# {self.settings.project_name}\\n\")\n\n    def define_wiki_config(self):\n\
    \        # Define the wiki structure\n        config = {\n            'sections':\
    \ [\n                {'name': 'Endpoints', 'file': 'endpoints.md'},\n        \
    \        {'name': 'Classes', 'file': 'classes.md'},\n                {'name':\
    \ 'Utilities', 'file': 'utilities.md'},\n                {'name': 'Examples',\
    \ 'file': 'examples.md'}\n            ]\n        }\n        return config\n\n\
    \    def process_file_changes(self, file_path):\n        if not self.settings.project_wiki\
    \ or not file_path.startswith(self.settings.project_path):\n            return\n\
    \n        # Extract relevant parts from the file\n        with open(file_path,\
    \ 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            content = f.read()\n\n        # Determine\
    \ which wiki file to update\n        wiki_file = self.determine_wiki_file(file_path)\n\
    \        if wiki_file:\n            self.update_wiki_file(wiki_file, content)\n\
    \n    def determine_wiki_file(self, file_path):\n        # Logic to determine\
    \ which wiki file to update based on file path\n        if 'endpoints' in file_path:\n\
    \            return 'endpoints.md'\n        elif 'classes' in file_path:\n   \
    \         return 'classes.md'\n        elif 'utils' in file_path:\n          \
    \  return 'utilities.md'\n        elif 'examples' in file_path:\n            return\
    \ 'examples.md'\n        return None\n\n    def update_wiki_file(self, wiki_file,\
    \ content):\n        wiki_file_path = os.path.join(self.wiki_path, wiki_file)\n\
    \        with open(wiki_file_path, 'a', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            f.write(content\
    \ + '\\n')\n\n    def rebuild_wiki(self):\n        # Rebuild the wiki using Vitepress\n\
    \        os.system(f\"cd {self.wiki_path} && npx vitepress build\")\n```\n\n###\
    \ Explanation\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The `initialize_wiki` method checks\
    \ if the project has a wiki setting and initializes the wiki directory if necessary.\n\
    \   - It creates a `home.md` file in the wiki directory.\n\n2. **Configuration**:\n\
    \   - The `define_wiki_config` method defines the structure of the wiki, including\
    \ sections and their corresponding markdown files.\n\n3. **Processing Changes**:\n\
    \   - The `process_file_changes` method monitors the project files for changes\
    \ and extracts relevant parts from the changed file.\n   - The `determine_wiki_file`\
    \ method determines which wiki file to update based on the file path.\n   - The\
    \ `update_wiki_file` method appends the extracted content to the appropriate wiki\
    \ file.\n\n4. **Rebuilding the Wiki**:\n   - The `rebuild_wiki` method uses Vitepress\
    \ to rebuild the wiki to reflect the changes.\n\n### Diagram\n\nHere\u2019s a\
    \ simple diagram to express the logic:\n\n```\n+-------------------+\n| Initialize\
    \ Wiki   |\n| Directory         |\n+-------------------+\n          |\n      \
    \    v\n+-------------------+\n| Define Wiki Config|\n+-------------------+\n\
    \          |\n          v\n+-------------------+\n| Process File      |\n| Changes\
    \           |\n+-------------------+\n          |\n          v\n+-------------------+\n\
    | Update Wiki File  |\n+-------------------+\n          |\n          v\n+-------------------+\n\
    | Rebuild Wiki      |\n+-------------------+\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that the\
    \ wiki is initialized, configured, and updated dynamically based on changes in\
    \ the project files."
