Given a file path:

 * Find all Documents associated with the file, use the document's "metadada.index" property to know the order of the documents.
* Chat with "wiki" profile and generate a wiki page.
* Use the get_categories to find the right category for the file or chat with "wiki" profile to decide which category to use
* Store the generate wiki page under wiki's path and category folder
