We must add a date time filter to LogViewer

To add a date-time filter to your `LogViewer` in the `codx-api` project, we need to follow a few steps to ensure the feature is implemented cleanly and efficiently. Here's a high-level plan:

1. **Understand the Current Implementation**: 
   - Review the existing codebase to understand how logs are currently being retrieved and displayed.
   - Identify the part of the codebase where the LogViewer functionality is implemented.

2. **Define Requirements**:
   - Determine how the date-time filter should function. For example, should it allow filtering by a specific date range, a single date, or both?
   - Decide on the format of date and time (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`).

3. **Update Backend Logic**:
   - If you're using a database, modify the query logic to filter logs based on the provided date-time criteria.
   - Update the API endpoint that fetches logs to accept date-time parameters.

4. **Modify Frontend (if applicable)**:
   - Add UI components for users to input date and time filters (e.g., date pickers or input fields).
   - Ensure the frontend communicates the filter parameters correctly to the backend.

5. **Add Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for the new date-time filter logic in your backend.
   - If applicable, add tests for the frontend to ensure the UI behaves correctly with the new filters.

6. **Document Changes**:
   - Update the project documentation to include information on how to use the new date-time filter feature.
   - Modify any existing documentation that might be affected by these changes.

7. **Version Control**:
   - Create a new branch in your Git repository dedicated to this feature (e.g., `feature/add-date-time-filter`).
   - Commit changes frequently with clear and descriptive commit messages.
   - Once the feature is implemented and tested, create a pull request for review.

8. **Agile Task Management**:
   - Break down the implementation into smaller tasks and manage them using your preferred agile tool (e.g., Jira, Trello).
   - Regularly update the task status and collaborate with team members to ensure the feature is delivered on time.

Here's a basic example of what a backend query might look like with a date-time filter:

```python
def get_logs(start_date=None, end_date=None):
    query = "SELECT * FROM logs WHERE 1=1"
    if start_date:
        query += f" AND timestamp >= '{start_date}'"
    if end_date:
        query += f" AND timestamp <= '{end_date}'"
    # Execute the query and return the results
```

And a simple way to handle this in the frontend could be:

```html
<input type="datetime-local" id="start-date" name="start-date">
<input type="datetime-local" id="end-date" name="end-date">
<button onclick="applyFilter()">Apply Filter</button>

<script>
function applyFilter() {
    const startDate = document.getElementById('start-date').value;
    const endDate = document.getElementById('end-date').value;
    // Make an API call with these parameters
}
</script>
```
