### Cache Milvus Connections per Project

**Objective:**
- Implement a caching mechanism for Milvus database connections per project to minimize the need for reconnecting every time a connection is required.

**Requirements:**
- Update the `KnowledgeDB` class to include a caching layer for `MilvusClient` instances.
- Ensure that connections are established only once per project and reused for subsequent operations.
- Consider thread-safety if the application is multi-threaded.

**Examples:**
- When a new `KnowledgeDB` instance is created, check if a connection for the same project already exists. If it does, use the cached connection instead of creating a new one.
- Implement a method to clear the cache if needed, for example, if the project configuration changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system should create a new `MilvusClient` connection only if one does not already exist for the given project.
- The cache should be accessible across instances of `KnowledgeDB` that operate under the same project.
- All methods that require a database connection should use the cached instance if available.
- Performance should be improved by reducing the number of connection attempts made to the Milvus database.

**Additional Notes:**
- Review the existing methods in `KnowledgeDB` to ensure they properly utilize the cached connections.
- Consider implementing logging to track connection usage and caching behavior for debugging purposes.
