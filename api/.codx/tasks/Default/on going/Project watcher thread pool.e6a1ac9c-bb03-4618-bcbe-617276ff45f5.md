### Implement Multi-threaded Project Watcher Notifications

**Objective:**
- Modify the project_watcher notifications to be processed in a new thread with a thread pool allowing up to 6 concurrent executions.

**Requirements:**
- Implement a threading model to handle notifications in separate threads.
- Use a thread pool to manage a maximum of 6 concurrent threads.
- Ensure that additional notifications wait for an available thread before execution.

**Examples:**
- If 10 notifications are triggered, 6 should be processed concurrently, and the remaining 4 should wait until threads are available.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Notifications are processed in a new thread distinct from the main application thread.
- No more than 6 notifications are processed at the same time.
- Additional notifications are queued and processed as threads become available.
- The system should handle edge cases like thread failures gracefully, ensuring no notification is lost.

**Additional Notes:**
- Consider using a library like `concurrent.futures` or `threading` in Python for implementing thread pools.
- Ensure proper thread management to avoid potential deadlocks or resource leaks.
- Evaluate the performance impact and optimize if necessary.

### Implementation Plan

To implement the threading model for handling project_watcher notifications, we will follow these steps:

1. **Set up a Thread Pool:**
   - Use Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to manage a fixed number of threads (6 in this case).

2. **Modify Notification Handling:**
   - Update the notification handler to submit tasks to the thread pool instead of executing them directly.

3. **Handle Queue Management:**
   - Ensure that notifications are queued if the maximum number of concurrent threads is reached.

4. **Graceful Handling of Exceptions:**
   - Implement robust exception handling to ensure that failures in one thread do not impact others.

5. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests to verify that the thread pool limits are respected and that notifications are processed correctly.
   - Test scenarios with varying numbers of notifications to ensure the system behaves as expected.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Update the project documentation to reflect changes in the notification handling process.
   - Document the new threading model, its limitations, and usage patterns.

### Sample Implementation

Here's a simple example using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

def handle_notification(notification):
    # Simulate notification handling
    print(f"Processing notification: {notification}")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a time-consuming task
    print(f"Finished processing notification: {notification}")

def process_notifications(notifications):
    # Set up a thread pool with a maximum of 6 workers
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=6) as executor:
        # Submit all notifications to the thread pool
        futures = [executor.submit(handle_notification, notification) for notification in notifications]

        # Ensure all notifications are processed and handle exceptions
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            try:
                future.result()  # This will raise any exceptions caught during thread execution
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Example usage
notifications = [f"Notification {i}" for i in range(10)]
process_notifications(notifications)
```

### Version Control and Documentation

- **Version Control:**
  - Commit the changes to a new branch named `feature/threaded-notifications`.
  - Push the branch to the repository and create a pull request for review.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README and any relevant documentation files to include the new threading capabilities.
  - Ensure automatic documentation updates by using tools like Sphinx if applicable.

- **Task Management:**
  - Track progress using task management tools (e.g., JIRA, Trello) to follow agile methodologies.

By following these steps, you can ensure that project_watcher notifications are handled efficiently and reliably in a multi-threaded environment.
