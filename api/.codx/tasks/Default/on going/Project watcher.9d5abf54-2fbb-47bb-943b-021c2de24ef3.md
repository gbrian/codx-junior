Based on the information provided, I will craft a task definition for implementing a file watching system for the `codx-api` project using the `watchdog` library. This system should monitor project files for changes, specifically for projects with the 'watching' setting set to `true`.

```md
### Implement Project File Watcher

**Objective:**
- Develop a file watching system to monitor changes in project files using the `watchdog` library. This system should activate for projects with the 'watching' setting enabled.

**Requirements:**
- Utilize the `watchdog` library to observe file changes.
- Integrate the file watching functionality into the existing `ProjectWatcher` class.
- Ensure the system checks for the 'watching' setting in `CODXJuniorSettings` before activating.
- Log file changes and handle them using the `process_project_changes` method from `CODXJuniorSession`.

**Examples:**
- Refer to the following example for setting up a basic file observer:
  ```python
  import time
  from watchdog.events import FileSystemEvent, FileSystemEventHandler
  from watchdog.observers import Observer

  class MyEventHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
      def on_any_event(self, event: FileSystemEvent) -> None:
          print(event)

  event_handler = MyEventHandler()
  observer = Observer()
  observer.schedule(event_handler, ".", recursive=True)
  observer.start()
  try:
      while True:
          time.sleep(1)
  finally:
      observer.stop()
      observer.join()
  ```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `ProjectWatcher` class successfully monitors file changes for projects with the 'watching' setting enabled.
- Detected file changes are logged appropriately.
- The `process_project_changes` method is invoked upon detecting changes.
- The system handles exceptions gracefully and logs errors.

**Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that the file watching does not interfere with other project operations.
- Consider performance implications of recursive file watching in large projects.
- Utilize the existing logging framework for consistency in error and change logging.
```

This task definition provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the requested functionality while integrating it with the existing project structure.

Implement code changes in project watcher to:
 - start watching changes on a project. Will receive project settings and use project_path as root folder to watch and a callback function to invoke with the files changed
- stop watching projects.

To implement the requested functionality in the `ProjectWatcher` class, I'll modify the class to support starting and stopping the file watching process based on project settings. The `watch_project` method will initiate the file watching, and I'll add a `stop_watching` method to cease watching. Here's how you can implement these changes:

```python
# /shared/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/project_watcher.py

import time
from typing import Callable
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEvent, FileSystemEventHandler
from watchdog.observers import Observer

class ProjectWatcher:
    """Project watcher will control project's changes by watching file changes"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.observers = {}

    def watch_project(self, settings: 'CODXJuniorSettings', callback: Callable[[str], None]):
        """Watch project changes using watchdog"""
        project_path = settings.project_path
        if settings.watching:
            event_handler = self._create_event_handler(callback)
            observer = Observer()
            observer.schedule(event_handler, project_path, recursive=True)
            observer.start()
            self.observers[project_path] = observer
            print(f"Started watching project at: {project_path}")

    def stop_watching(self, project_path: str):
        """Stop watching project changes"""
        observer = self.observers.pop(project_path, None)
        if observer:
            observer.stop()
            observer.join()
            print(f"Stopped watching project at: {project_path}")

    @staticmethod
    def _create_event_handler(callback: Callable[[str], None]) -> FileSystemEventHandler:
        class CustomEventHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
            def on_any_event(self, event: FileSystemEvent):
                if not event.is_directory:
                    callback(event.src_path)
        
        return CustomEventHandler()

# Example usage:
# settings = CODXJuniorSettings(watching=True, project_path='/path/to/project')
# watcher = ProjectWatcher()
# watcher.watch_project(settings, lambda file_path: print(f"Changed: {file_path}"))
# ... later on ...
# watcher.stop_watching('/path/to/project')
```

### Key Additions:

1. **Observers Storage**: Introduced a dictionary `self.observers` to store active observers indexed by their project paths, allowing us to stop them later.

2. **`watch_project` Method**: This method now accepts a `callback` parameter, which is a function that gets invoked with the file path of any changed files. It starts the observer if the `watching` setting is enabled.

3. **`stop_watching` Method**: This method stops the observer associated with the given project path and removes it from the `self.observers` dictionary.

4. **`_create_event_handler` Method**: A helper method to create a custom event handler that calls the provided callback function whenever a file event occurs.

This setup allows for flexible file watching within projects and provides an easy way to start and stop monitoring changes based on project settings.

To implement the `watch_project` callable function effectively, we need to ensure it handles the project settings and the file changes appropriately. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how we can achieve this:

### Step 1: Define the Function

First, we'll define the `watch_project` function. We'll assume that the project settings and file changes are provided as arguments.

```python
def watch_project(project_settings, file_changed):
    """
    Monitors project settings and file changes to trigger necessary actions.

    :param project_settings: dict containing project configuration settings
    :param file_changed: str representing the path to the changed file
    """
    # Example implementation
    handle_file_change(project_settings, file_changed)
```

### Step 2: Implement File Change Handling

Create a helper function that handles the logic when a file changes. This might include tasks like rebuilding, running tests, or updating documentation.

```python
def handle_file_change(project_settings, file_changed):
    """
    Handles actions to be taken when a file changes.

    :param project_settings: dict containing project configuration settings
    :param file_changed: str representing the path to the changed file
    """
    print(f"File changed: {file_changed}")
    # Implement logic based on project settings
    if project_settings.get('auto_test'):
        run_tests(file_changed)
    if project_settings.get('auto_document'):
        update_documentation(file_changed)
```

### Step 3: Implement Task Functions

Implement the functions for tasks like running tests or updating documentation.

```python
def run_tests(file_changed):
    """
    Run unit tests for the changed file.

    :param file_changed: str representing the path to the changed file
    """
    print(f"Running tests for {file_changed}")
    # Placeholder for actual test-running logic
    # Example: subprocess.run(["pytest", file_changed])

def update_documentation(file_changed):
    """
    Automatically update documentation for the changed file.

    :param file_changed: str representing the path to the changed file
    """
    print(f"Updating documentation for {file_changed}")
    # Placeholder for actual documentation update logic
    # Example: subprocess.run(["make", "docs"])
```

### Step 4: Add Version Control

Ensure that any changes are tracked using Git. This involves staging changes, committing them with appropriate messages, and pushing them to a remote repository.

```bash
# Example shell commands for Git version control
git add .
git commit -m "Handle change in file: <file_changed>"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Write Unit Tests

Create unit tests to verify the functionality of the `watch_project` function and its helpers. Use a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.

```python
def test_handle_file_change():
    # Example test case
    settings = {'auto_test': True, 'auto_document': True}
    file = "example.py"
    handle_file_change(settings, file)
    # Assert expected outcomes, e.g., logs, function calls
```

### Step 6: Documentation

Document the code and update any project documentation whenever changes are made. This can include updating `README.md` files or generating documentation using tools like Sphinx.

By following these steps, we ensure that the `watch_project` function is well-implemented, maintainable, and adheres to best practices.
