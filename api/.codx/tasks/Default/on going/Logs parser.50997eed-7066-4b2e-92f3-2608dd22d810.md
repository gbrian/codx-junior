To create a logs parser that extracts information from a log stream, we can utilize Python's regular expressions to match and extract relevant parts of each log entry. The solution will involve reading each line, identifying log entries using a regular expression pattern, and accumulating the content until a new log entry is detected.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can implement this:

1. **Regular Expression Pattern**: We'll define a regex pattern to capture the timestamp, log level, module, line number, and content.
2. **Iterate Over Logs**: We'll read through each line of the log, applying the regex pattern.
3. **Accumulate Content**: If a line starts a new entry, we'll save the accumulated content to the last log entry and start a new entry.
4. **Return Data**: Finally, we'll return the parsed log entries as a list of dictionaries.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
import re
from typing import List, Dict

def parse_logs(log_stream: str) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    log_entries = []
    log_entry = None

    # Define the regex pattern for log lines
    log_pattern = re.compile(
        r'^\[(?P<timestamp>[^\]]+)\]\s+(?P<level>\w+)\s+\[(?P<module>[^\]:]*):(?P<line>\d+)\]\s+(?P<content>.*)$'
    )

    for line in log_stream.splitlines():
        match = log_pattern.match(line)
        if match:
            # If there's a match, it indicates a new log entry
            if log_entry:
                # Append the accumulated log entry to the list
                log_entries.append(log_entry)
            
            # Start a new log entry
            log_entry = {
                "timestamp": match.group('timestamp'),
                "level": match.group('level'),
                "module": match.group('module'),
                "line": int(match.group('line')),
                "content": match.group('content').strip()
            }
        elif log_entry:
            # Accumulate content lines that are part of the previous log entry
            log_entry["content"] += "\n" + line.strip()

    # Don't forget to add the last log entry
    if log_entry:
        log_entries.append(log_entry)

    return log_entries

# Example usage
log_stream = """

parsed_logs = parse_logs(log_stream)
for log in parsed_logs:
    print(log)
```

### Explanation:

- **Regex Pattern**: The regex pattern is designed to capture the timestamp, log level, module, line number, and initial content of the log entry.
- **Log Handling**: For each new log line that matches the pattern, a new log entry is created and the previous entry is stored. Additional content lines are appended to the `content` field of the current log entry until a new entry begins.
- **Edge Cases**: The function ensures that the last log entry is added to the list, even if the log ends abruptly.

### Testing and Documentation:

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to ensure the parser correctly handles different log formats and multiline content.
- **Documentation**: Document the function with examples of usage and expected output. This will be helpful for future reference and for other developers working on the project.

This implementation is a starting point and can be further refined based on specific requirements or additional log formats.

Great, let's dig into custom data extarcted from content.
First case: "Request entries"
Some logs are request info with url, status code and time taken like:
```txt
Request https://0.0.0.0:9984/api/logs/codx-junior-api?size=undefined&codx_path=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fcodx-junior%2Fapi%2F.codx - 0.008777618408203125 ms
INFO:     116.203.61.7:0 - "GET /api/logs/codx-junior-api?size=undefined&codx_path=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fcodx-junior%2Fapi%2F.codx HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```


We'll create a request_extractor that will check content for: url, status_code and time_taken, if found will return an json object with the info
## [[{"role": "assistant", "task_item": "", "hide": false, "improvement": false, "created_at": "2025-01-15 09:21:16.609110", "updated_at": "2025-01-15 09:21:16.609133", "images": [], "files": []}]]
To extract custom data from log content, such as request entries, we'll need to extend our parser with a function that specifically looks for patterns in the log content that match the request information. This involves identifying lines that contain URLs, status codes, and timing information, then extracting these pieces of data into a structured format.

Here's how we can implement the `request_extractor` function to identify and extract this information from log content:

1. **Identify Patterns**: Use regular expressions to identify patterns in the log content that represent request details.
2. **Extract Data**: Parse the URL, status code, and time taken from the identified patterns.
3. **Return Structured Data**: Return the extracted information as a JSON-like dictionary object.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
import re
from typing import Optional, Dict

def request_extractor(content: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, str]]:
    # Define regex patterns to capture url, status_code, and time_taken
    url_pattern = re.compile(
        r'Request\s+(?P<url>https?://[^\s]+)\s+-\s+(?P<time_taken>\d+\.\d+)\s+ms'
    )
    status_code_pattern = re.compile(
        r'\s"(?P<method>GET|POST|PUT|DELETE|PATCH|OPTIONS|HEAD)\s+[^\s]+\s+HTTP/1.1"\s+(?P<status_code>\d{3})'
    )

    # Attempt to match patterns in the content
    url_match = url_pattern.search(content)
    status_code_match = status_code_pattern.search(content)

    if url_match and status_code_match:
        # Extract and return the information if both patterns are matched
        return {
            "url": url_match.group('url'),
            "status_code": status_code_match.group('status_code'),
            "time_taken": url_match.group('time_taken')
        }
    
    # Return None if no request info is found
    return None

# Example usage
log_content = """
Request https://0.0.0.0:9984/api/logs/codx-junior-api?size=undefined&codx_path=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fcodx-junior%2Fapi%2F.codx - 0.008777618408203125 ms
INFO:     116.203.61.7:0 - "GET /api/logs/codx-junior-api?size=undefined&codx_path=%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fcodx-junior%2Fapi%2F.codx HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
"""

request_info = request_extractor(log_content)
if request_info:
    print(request_info)
```

### Explanation:

- **Regex Patterns**:
  - The `url_pattern` captures the URL and time taken from the first line of the log entry.
  - The `status_code_pattern` captures the HTTP method and status code from the second line.
  
- **Data Extraction**:
  - If both patterns are found, the function extracts and returns the URL, status code, and time taken as a dictionary.
  
- **Functionality**:
  - The function returns `None` if it does not find a matching request pattern, allowing the calling code to handle cases where no request information is present.

### Testing and Integration:

- **Unit Tests**: Create unit tests for `request_extractor` to verify that it correctly extracts data from various log entries and handles cases without request information.
- **Integration**: Integrate the `request_extractor` into the main log parser function to automatically enrich log entries with request information when applicable.

This setup allows for the easy extension of the log parser to handle additional custom data extraction scenarios in the future.

Now I need a function decorator that will take time taken by the function and possible errors throw and generate a log entry with the information: function name, error and time_taken.

## [[{"role": "assistant", "task_item": "", "hide": false, "improvement": false, "created_at": "2025-01-15 09:58:37.632671", "updated_at": "2025-01-15 09:58:37.632695", "images": [], "files": []}]]
To create a function decorator that logs the execution time and any potential errors of a function, we'll need to use Python's `functools` module to create the decorator. This decorator will:

1. **Measure Execution Time**: Use the `time` module to measure the start and end time of the function execution.
2. **Catch Exceptions**: Use a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions thrown by the function.
3. **Log Information**: Create a log entry containing the function name, any error that occurred, and the time taken for execution.

Here's how we can implement such a decorator:

```python
import time
import functools
import logging

# Set up basic configuration for logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def log_execution_time_and_errors(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        error = None
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            error = str(e)
            raise
        finally:
            end_time = time.time()
            time_taken = end_time - start_time
            # Generate the log entry
            log_message = (
                f"Function '{func.__name__}' executed in {time_taken:.6f} seconds"
            )
            if error:
                log_message += f" with error: {error}"
                logging.error(log_message)
            else:
                logging.info(log_message)
    
    return wrapper

# Example usage
@log_execution_time_and_errors
def example_function(x):
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative value not allowed")
    return x * 2

# Test the decorator
try:
    print(example_function(5))
    print(example_function(-1))
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")

```

### Explanation:

- **`functools.wraps`**: This decorator is used to ensure that the decorated function retains its original name and docstring, which is useful for debugging and introspection.
- **Timing**: We use `time.time()` to capture the start and end times of the function execution, calculating the time taken.
- **Error Handling**: The `try-except-finally` block allows us to catch any exceptions, log them, and re-raise them after logging.
- **Logging**: The decorator logs the function's execution time and any error encountered, using Python's `logging` module.

### Testing and Usage:

- The `example_function` demonstrates how the decorator works. It logs execution time for successful runs and execution time with error details for exceptions.
- You can test this decorator with different functions to ensure it logs the necessary information correctly.

This decorator can be applied to any function where you want to track execution time and errors, making it a useful tool for debugging and performance monitoring.
