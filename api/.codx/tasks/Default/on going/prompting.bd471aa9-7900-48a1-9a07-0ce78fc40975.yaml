- content: "Certainly! Here's a structured prompt you can use to instruct a language\
    \ model to apply best practices to a file's content:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\
    You are given a section of code that requires improvement by applying best practices.\
    \ Your task is to refactor the code while ensuring that it adheres to the specified\
    \ best practices. Please follow the instructions below:\n\n### File Content:\n\
    ```\n{file_content}\n```\n\n### Best Practices:\n- Ensure code readability by\
    \ using meaningful variable and function names.\n- Implement consistent code formatting\
    \ (indentation, line spacing, etc.).\n- Optimize code for performance where applicable.\n\
    - Add comments and documentation to explain complex logic.\n- Apply error handling\
    \ and input validation.\n- Write clean and maintainable code following DRY (Don't\
    \ Repeat Yourself) principles.\n- Ensure compatibility with the latest version\
    \ of the language/framework.\n- Add unit tests to verify code functionality.\n\
    - Use version control effectively to track changes.\n- Document all changes clearly\
    \ in a changelog.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Refactor the provided code content\
    \ using the best practices outlined above.\n2. Ensure the code is well-commented\
    \ and documented.\n3. Add any necessary unit tests to confirm the correctness\
    \ of the refactored code.\n4. Provide a brief summary of the changes made and\
    \ the reasoning behind them.\n\nPlease proceed with applying these best practices\
    \ to the given file content.\n\n--- \n\nThis prompt is designed to guide the language\
    \ model in refactoring code by applying a comprehensive set of best practices."
