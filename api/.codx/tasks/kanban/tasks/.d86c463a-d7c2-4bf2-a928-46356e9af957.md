Hello! I'm ready to help. Could you clarify what you need assistance with? For example:
1. Understanding the code snippet
2. Modifying the code
3. Explaining specific parts of the implementation
4. Other related requests

The code appears to handle knowledge search functionality with two modes (embeddings/source) and includes logging, document retrieval, and chat interaction components.
