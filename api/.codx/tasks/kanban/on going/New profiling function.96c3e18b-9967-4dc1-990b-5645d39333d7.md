Create a profiling function decorator to take time taken by functions and log like: "Profiler: {"method": "method_name", "time_taken": 1.234 }"Â 
## [[{"role": "assistant", "task_item": "", "hide": false, "improvement": false, "created_at": "2025-01-16 18:58:30.209178", "updated_at": "2025-01-16 18:58:30.209204", "images": [], "files": ["/codx/junior/app.py"]}]]
To create a profiling function decorator that logs the time taken by functions, we can draw inspiration from the `add_process_time_header` function you provided. The decorator will capture the start time before the function execution, calculate the elapsed time after the function completes, and log the method name and time taken in the specified format. Here's how you can implement this:

```python
# /usr/local/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/profiler.py
import time
import logging

# Configure logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def profile_function(func):
    """Decorator to profile a function and log the execution time."""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return result
        finally:
            end_time = time.time()
            time_taken = end_time - start_time
            logger.info(f'Profiler: {{"method": "{func.__name__}", "time_taken": {time_taken:.3f} }}')
    return wrapper

# Example usage
@profile_function
def sample_function(duration):
    """A sample function to demonstrate the profiler."""
    time.sleep(duration)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_function(1)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Logging Setup**: We set up a basic logger to capture and display log messages.
   
2. **Decorator Definition**: The `profile_function` decorator wraps the target function. It starts a timer, executes the function, and finally computes the elapsed time.

3. **Logging**: Logs the method name and time taken in the specified format.

4. **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to use the decorator with a sample function.

### Best Practices:

- **Version Control**: Ensure this new file and changes are committed to your Git repository with appropriate commit messages.
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests to verify that the decorator correctly logs the time taken for various functions. Consider edge cases, such as functions that raise exceptions.
- **Documentation**: Update your project's documentation to include information about the new `profile_function` decorator and how to apply it.

By following these steps, you ensure that your code is well-organized, maintainable, and easy to integrate into your existing project.

To provide a comprehensive example of how to use the `profile_function` decorator we discussed earlier, let's incorporate it into a simple Python script. This will help clarify its usage and demonstrate its integration into your project. We'll create a sample function that performs a basic task, such as simulating a delay with `time.sleep`, and apply the decorator to it.

Here is the complete script with the decorator and a usage example:

```python
# /usr/local/codx-junior/api/codx/junior/profiler.py
import time
import logging

# Configure logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def profile_function(func):
    """Decorator to profile a function and log the execution time."""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            return result
        finally:
            end_time = time.time()
            time_taken = end_time - start_time
            logger.info(f'Profiler: {{"method": "{func.__name__}", "time_taken": {time_taken:.3f} }}')
    return wrapper

# Example function to demonstrate the profiler usage
@profile_function
def compute_factorial(n):
    """Compute factorial of a number."""
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * compute_factorial(n-1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Using the decorated function
    number = 5
    result = compute_factorial(number)
    logger.info(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Decorator Setup**: The `profile_function` decorator measures the time taken for `compute_factorial` to execute and logs it.

2. **Example Function**: `compute_factorial` is a simple recursive function used to calculate the factorial of a number.

3. **Usage**: In the `__main__` block, we call `compute_factorial` with an example input, demonstrating how the function is profiled and logged.

### Best Practices:

- **Logging**: Ensure the logging level is set appropriately in the real-world application to avoid excessive logging in production environments.
- **Documentation**: Update your project's documentation to include this usage example, providing clear guidance on how to apply the decorator.
- **Testing and Validation**: Write unit tests for `profile_function` to ensure it correctly logs the execution time. Consider edge cases and potential exceptions.

By following these practices, you can ensure that the profiling functionality is integrated smoothly into your project, providing valuable insights into function performance while maintaining clean and maintainable code.
