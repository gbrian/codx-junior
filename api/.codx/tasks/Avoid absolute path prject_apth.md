Yes, if the `project_path` is empty when reading the `project.json` file, you should use the main path passed to the `load_settings` function as the default.

Where are projects scanned from local drive?

Projects are scanned from the local drive using the `find_all_projects` function in the `engine.py` file. This function utilizes the `subprocess.run` method with the `find` command to locate directories named `.codx` from the root directory `/`. It then checks if these directories contain a `project.json` file, which indicates the presence of a project. This process is initiated during the application's startup, as indicated by the call to `find_all_projects()` in the `app.py` file.
