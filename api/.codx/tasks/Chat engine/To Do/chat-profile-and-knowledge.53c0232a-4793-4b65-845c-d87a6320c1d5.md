When the user message is from a profile and it has "use knowledge" setting set to True, we'll search in the chat's project knowledge.


Extract the search method to a new private method that will receive the chat, the user message.
The _search_knowledge method will get the chat description and user message to search for related documents in the chat's project knowledge base.

To implement your request, we'll extract the search functionality related to the chat's project knowledge base into a new private method called `_search_knowledge`. This method will take the `chat` and `user_message` as parameters and will perform the necessary operations to search for related documents in the knowledge base when the user message is from a profile with the "use knowledge" setting set to True.

Here's the modified version of your code with the extracted method:

### Key Changes:
- **New Method `_search_knowledge`:** This method encapsulates the search functionality within the chat's project knowledge base. It takes `chat`, `user_message`, `search_projects`, `ignore_documents`, `response_message`, and `messages` as parameters to perform the search efficiently.
- **Integration with `chat_with_project`:** The call to this new method has been integrated into the `chat_with_project` function.
- **Error Handling:** The new method also contains error handling to log and notify in case of search errors. 

Make sure to correctly align and integrate this new method into the existing architecture, keeping all dependencies and imports intact.
