Capture code blocks in the chat responses and replace them with the code returned by 
Code blocks has a starting fence "```" followed by the coding language and optional a file_path like


```js a_java_script_file.js
console.log("hello world")
```
In this example we'll call  code_writer(language, file_path)

To achieve the task of capturing code blocks in chat responses and replacing them with the code returned by the `code_writer` function, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Parse the Chat Messages:** Identify and extract code blocks from the chat responses. Each code block starts with a fence "```" followed by the optional language and file path.

2. **Call `code_writer`:** For each identified code block, invoke the `code_writer` function with the extracted code, language, and file path.

3. **Replace Code Blocks:** Replace the original code block in the chat response with the code returned by the `code_writer` function.

Let's go ahead and implement this logic in Python. We will focus on modifying the `chat_with_project` method within the `ChatEngine` class to include this functionality. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import re
import asyncio

# Assume code_writer function is defined elsewhere as per provided code

async def process_chat_responses(chat_messages):
    """
    Process chat messages to replace code blocks with code returned by code_writer.
    
    Args:
        chat_messages (list): List of chat messages to process.
    
    Returns:
        list: List of processed chat messages.
    """
    code_block_pattern = re.compile(r'```(\w+)?( [^\n]+)?\n([\s\S]+?)\n```')

    async def process_code_block(match):
        language = match.group(1) or "plaintext"
        file_path = match.group(2).strip() if match.group(2) else None
        code_text = match.group(3)
        
        # Call code_writer function
        if file_path:
            processed_code = await code_writer(code_text, file_path, language)
        else:
            processed_code = await code_writer(code_text, "unknown_file", language)
        
        return f"```{language} {file_path}\n{processed_code}\n```"

    async def process_message(message):
        return await asyncio.gather(
            *[process_code_block(match) for match in code_block_pattern.finditer(message)]
        )

    processed_messages = []
    for message in chat_messages:
        processed_message = await process_message(message)
        processed_messages.append(code_block_pattern.sub(lambda m: processed_message.pop(0), message))
    
    return processed_messages

# Example usage
# chat_messages = ["Some message with a code block: ```js /path/to/file.js\nconsole.log('example')\n```"]
# processed_chat_messages = asyncio.run(process_chat_responses(chat_messages))
# print(processed_chat_messages)
```

In this implementation:

- We define a `process_chat_responses` function that takes a list of chat messages.
- We use a regular expression to find code blocks in each message.
- For each code block, we extract the language, file path, and code text.
- We call the `code_writer` function asynchronously for each code block and replace the original block with the processed code.
- The function returns a list of messages with updated code blocks.

This setup allows you to process chat messages that contain multiple code blocks, ensuring that each block is evaluated and replaced accordingly.
