description: '1. The user clarified that when referring to "tools," they are not discussing
  the toolset that can be invoked with "tool_calls."

  2. Instructions were provided to include the file name after the code block extension
  when creating file content.

  3. There was a requirement to return the file path when using project_search or
  read_file tools, and to add the ChatMessage to the messages collection.

  4. Suggestions were requested for changes in chat completion methods and tool implementations
  to manage responses with tool_calls.

  5. The user asked for a method to generate new messages from tool_call responses
  and pass them back to the AI for further processing.'

- content: 'When AI chat calls project_search or read_file tool we must return the
    file path among the response.

    Tools will return a ChatMessage and completions will add this ChatMessage to the
    messages collection. Suggest changes in the chat completion methods and tools
    implementations for this.


    Important, when reading tools_call remember it''s an array so we must manage all
    tool calls in the AI response.

    Suggest changes on how to manage responses with tool_calls. I''d like all responses
    to generate new messages to be added to current chat conversation and pass them  again
    back to AI
