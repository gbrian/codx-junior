Define browser requierements:
- It must allow to run browser-use agent through an API
- It must expose "chat" endpoint for interacting with the agent
- A browser must be always running so user can interact with it

The project files indicate the following browser requirements:

1. **API for Browser-Use Agent:** The system allows running a browser-use agent through an API. This is implemented in the `browse` function, which utilizes the `Agent` class to execute tasks using AI settings provided in the payload.

2. **Chat Endpoint:** There is a "chat" endpoint for interacting with the agent, as seen in the `BrowsePayload` that includes a `chat` attribute. This implies that users can send chat messages to the agent via the API.

3. **Constantly Running Browser:** The browser must always be running to facilitate continuous interaction. This is suggested by the asynchronous operations and the startup event in the FastAPI application, ensuring the system is ready to handle interactions anytime.

The provided code snippets and documentation support these requirements by detailing how to set up the agent and the FastAPI server, as well as the functionalities of the `browser-use` library.
